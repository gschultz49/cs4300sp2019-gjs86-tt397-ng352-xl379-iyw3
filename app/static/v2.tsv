0	0	Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 35	['Synthetic', 'Fashion Trend: Ankle-High Mesh Running Shoe']	I like how they look and the moccasin-like shape (a much smaller portion of the shoe is kept by shoe laces). Like its predecessors, they are durable, and wear well. The fit is a bit funky... I buy the Pegasus 1/2 size larger, and it was always a good fit. Of the proper running shoes I tried from Brooks, Saucony, New Balance, etc, I found these Nikes have the softest sole while still providing good support for my relatively flat feet (I use some arch support insoles with them). The sock-like fit and exceptional shock absorption really save my knees and back when I jog. Really like them. Avid runner here, I run 5 miles a day for the last few years. Wow what a mistake. The left shoe is super wonky fitting. I would of bought free runs if NIKE got their crap together and released the 2019's I would of gladly paid $40 more than these garbage shoes. I'm guessing people who gave these good reviews never used the Flyknit Freeruns. My feet already feel like I have plantar fasciitis starting. I gave an extra star because atleast they have good laces lol These are very cool looking shoes, but they just didnt fit right to me. At first it felt fine, then walking around the house for a few minutes it felt tight. So I was nervous when I decided to try this particular shoe after years of running in the Nike Lunar Glide series, but wow, im glad I did it. Took this pair for a 10 mile run right out of the box that was mostly streets and sidewalks, but also had about 3 miles of cross-country in a hilly park and they were fantastic in all 3 conditions. Terrific traction and bounce and the upper wrapped very nicely around my feet. I wish I had kept the laces from my last pair of Lunar Glides because they NEVER came untied. I like everything about the shoe, except for the fact that after just one month of running about 15 miles per week, the outsole has already worn away at the outside edge of the heel. It could be just me, but I ran much faster and easier with these than with my other running shoes. Like I learned in basketball never short on shoes if you plan to use them a lot. These shoes have tons of cushion and adapt to your feet very well. I have very flat feet and had problems with other running shoes but these are fine. Worth it if you can afford it.	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Mens-Zoom-Pegasus-Running/dp/B075ZXLCV3?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CZQ8VN1&psc=1

TORSION® SYSTEM, placed between the he']	The Adidas Ultra boost are an extremely popular shoe these days, and while they are very comfortable for the average width foot, they will not work if your foot is wide. I see one reviewer said just the opposite, noting they had a lot of room in the toe box area, but I have been wearing wide shoes for years and the ultraboost are definitely too narrow for my foot. Another reviewer said the shoe fits like a sock, and I would agree that is a perfect description. The shoe is very form-fitting to the foot and almost feels like a sock when it is on, but again, if you have wide feet these shoes will feel quite constricting. I would also agree with the assessment I've seen in some other reviews that you should order a half size larger than your normal shoe size. My younger son has had his Utraboosts for five months now and they are holding up well. Both kids think the Ultraboosts are very comfortable as well. I bought these because I previously bought a pair of Ultraboost uncaged and love them. I thought I would try the standard Ultraboost since I run in them (though I am not a marathoner) and I wanted to see if they might provide better support for running. At this point I still prefer the uncaged version, but these are still comfortable and I don't seem to get pain in my knees like I have with other brands. Better of just spending the extra dough to get them at the store or find a better shoe. Cool idea for a shoe but for the price you can just about buy 2 pairs of vans or even new balance 574s... even almost 2 pairs of brooks if youre a runner I'm a size 7 mens in new balance. I got them and they fit especially tightly in the toe box area (vertically though). So after watching some videos I decided to take the soles out and that solved my fitting issue. They feel great on feet even just on the boost. For me the biggest thing is they are a really great looking pair of shoes for any occasion. I hope my fitting experience helps someone in a similar spot. My son couldn't get over how comfortable theses shoes are. The order came quick and they are perfect. My son loves the comfort and style of the shoes. If you are someone with wide feet like my son, youll enjoy the flexibility of the material. I think Addidas shoes in general fits better for wider feet better than some of the other competitive brands. OK, If are like my and are trying to avoid getting a fake these are genuine Adidas ultra boost. when I first got them I went to an Adidas retail to have them checked and they told me after they inspected it that was OK. Continental soil is not shiny , boost pattern is not the same in both shoes, has 5 strips on the back, the boost also has the nipples . so far they feel super good and are performing OK. I use them 4 days a week to work as I work standing for 10 hours a day	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Performance-Ultra-Boost-Running/dp/B07D7XTJBV?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00WW7JCCG&psc=1

3	3	Nike Epic React Flyknit	"['Synthetic', 'Synthetic', 'Band New', '100% Original', 'Authentic', ""For Men's""]"	Sought these out because they were highly rated running shoes, but I didn't want to pay an extra 50 bucks for different colors; managed to snag these and have recieved lots of compliments. Overall great shoe so far. Very comfortable sneakers I've owned probably 30 pairs of Nike low tops over the past 10 years and these are by far the best. They are Free comfort with more cushion if that makes since. Also extremely light. five star Better than ultra boost no.But still a great running shoe.No break in ready to go straight out of the box. Super comfortable. Excelente The Nike Epic React Flynit 1s are an amazingly responsive shoe. It really feels like the shoe is kicking back with every step. The outer sole is surprisingly durable keeping the shoes shape for long periods of time. I personally have been wearing these shoes since they have come out and they are as good as everyone has said they are. I have been wearing the shoes daily since I bought them, and they are still in great condition. If you are looking for one of the most comfortable running shoes out there, then look no further. First, I want to start off by saying they are true to size. However, they fit perfectly to my feet the more I wore them, so size wont be a problem for you. The fit is great around the ankle, having a nice natural feel to it. The flynit holds your feet in, creating little space for movement within the shoe. These shoes also, have good bounce to them and are perfect if you want a shoe that responds to your feet. Secondly, the shoes are very well built. As I stated before, I wear mine just about every day and they are still in great condition (with little wrinkles on the bottom sole). The shoe also has great traction on them due to small rubber spots on the heels and toes. I think they are a great all-around running shoe. I hope my review helped make your decision easier	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-React-Flyknit-Running-AQ0067/dp/B07CGD3KM2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07QTJQSFQ&psc=1

Removable cushi']	Since I routinely track-walk about a mile or so each day, the doctor felt I could benefit from a better walking shoe than the one I was using, which over time was causing soreness on the underside of the feet. Brooks provided the foot support I needed to walk comfortably and without soreness to my feet. The doctor said Brooks run a bit small, so I ordered 11.5M instead of 11M. It fit perfectly. They are a bit more expensive and lack the design a good looking tennis shoe, but the benefit of comfort and overall feeling is worth it. They sent me a replacement pair for free, and let me chose any model. I went with the new Beast 18 and they are amazing. The Glycerine shoes have gotten better- both in comfort and support- as the years have gone by. Id also like to point out that I also bought these particular shoes because of their durability. Ive been a fan of Brooks Glycerins since the 4s. I really like updates they did on these shoes and the fit to me is snug and secure. I only wish theyd come in better colors. I am a heavy runner and these shoes still run well for me. I still really do like the updates. The previous versions of the 12D were just fine for me. My shoes are too large but theyre comfortable. I recommend you order the size you wear first and go from there. The only reason I picked too large  for fit is because everyone was saying to order a larger size. I have had Glycerin 13, 14, and 15 and they fit fine so its my own fault for ordering these 16s a half size larger. These are the most comfortable Glycerins Ive had even though theyre too big. They fit almost perfectly, with just a little spare room in the toe. I describe the comfort like walking on clouds, I almost forget my feet are making contact with the Earth. My previous Brooks that are 10's are just as comfortable and fitting, as this. My feet have not hurt once. They have always been a perfect shoe. These Glycerin 16s, however, seem like a completely different shoe. The toe box is wider, which may be fine for some, but it makes my feet slide around. Additionally, these shoes seem to have a high arch (at least more than previous models) as well as a high outer edge on the insoles. There is a major improvement on the cushioning but the mesh absorbs too much water/ sweat to a point that feels like you are running with two bricks	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Glycerin-16/dp/B077K9HZ3B?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07DH659TH&psc=1

I generally put 450-600 miles on each pair, wash them, and then use them as casual shoes. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a support shoe. Great looking designs as well. I feel like these are so much better than the gts 17. Great shoes. He loves them. He's worn only Brooks shoes for running for years now and has always been comfortable in them. I'd definitely order them again if he needed some more. The GTS 18 bears no resemblance to my favorite GTS 16 sneakers, there is no support or durability and seems like Brooks just gave up on their brand. Brooks are a great running shoe. Stability shoes keep me from shin splints. not very impressed with these shoes, already falling apart These are great shoes. Love them. The sneakers have been very good on relieving the pressure he felt with other sneakers. The cushioning is great as well.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071NSP2JQ/ref=asc_df_B071NSP2JQ1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B071NSP2JQ&linkCode=asn&psc=1

This, the ""Venture 6"", is the latest to undergo the transformation from great feeling shoe to complete garbage. The materials used are cheaper, the thickness of padding and support have been minimized, all resulting in this piece of garbage I now own. Luckily the Venture 5 shoe is still available so I will be be getting another pair of those. I'm pretty sure I either have a knock off or an irregular. Those were soo comfortable and like walking on springy cushion I wanted another pair for my general use. While they fit just fine, and are nice sneakers there was something off about them. I walked up and down my street in the orange and the put on the blue and green I bought from Amazon and there is clearly a comfort difference. I wills still keep them since they do fit my needs and won't be using them for my exercise regimen Like I said they are fine for what they are . If it's the latter then Amazon should describe them as such ""irregular"" For decades Ive been using expensive ASICS GT series running shoes. Now that I am getting old and walking instead of running, I am finding that Gel-Venture sneakers are more comfortable for all day wear and just as protective, at half the price. They have the added feature of a covering tab to protect the top of the show from wearing out in the front due to rising big toe issues, the major source of wear on my expensive ASICS GT2000 series shoes, which lack this feature. Do your feet a favor and skip this one. These fit perfectly, but if you are new to Asics, they run small in both length and width. Absolutely love the ASICS Gel-Venture series - have owned Series 4, 5 and 6 now and will keep buying them. I like that these have just the right amount of cushion without being bulky After one week the mesh material on the side of the shoe is fraying badly...They are comfortable, and good looking shoes....but not up to the quality I've come to expect from Asics. Would not recommend These fit pretty well. I had a pair of New Balance previously that I really liked, but couldn't find a new pair that was acceptable to replace with. These Asics fit fine. I do have a fairly flat foot, so hoping the slight arch in these doesn't cause an issue. It is definitely a smaller arch than many other brands. Quality looks pretty good - time will tell. I could recommend, definitely for those needing wider widths."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Venture-Running-Shoe/dp/B071L2TYW1?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0719MHX9L&psc=1

It's a good sneaker, but I feel it fits a little bit looser width wise. It's still a good running sneaker, and I like the added heel cushion on my endurance runs, but I don't feel like it has the same support the Ghost 10 had. Fit is true to size for me, good toe box room, and soft around the ankle while still feeling locked in. At almost one hundred miles in my feet and legs are happy, I didnt know running shoes could be this good. These are awesome shoes. A ton of value for the price. Nice light comfortable running shoe. I do mostly pavement these days, but have done a fair amount of running on the fire roads and trails as well. I'm in my 60's and I like a more traditional shoe with some padding underfoot. This is a good all-rounder and I have not had any trouble with my legs (knock knock) since changing to the Brooks shoes. They run pretty true to size. I have the 10 and these Ghost 11 pair is amazingly better. They fit perfectly and like my 10s they remove shin splints from my routine. Very comfortable shoes if you need a neutral. No need to break them in because they are perfect out of the box. Speaking of box, the toe box is roomy but supportive. If you want a comfortable running shoe with great cushioning, try these on. My only wish is for Brooks to come out with even more bright and loud color ways for men. I like shoes that are loud. Great kicks. Nike and Adidas are great for style but if you want a shoe for actually running or working out, these are the ones. By far some of the best running shoes. if your a neutral runner who does NOT overpronate this is the best ""cushioning"" shoe on the markert. I have both the Hoka one one Bondi 6 and clifton 4, I find myself favoring the Ghost 11s for long runs. Theise fit my needs. Positives
The delivery was very quick. The colors are awesome. The shoes seem to be comfortable (no run yet, to cold). Price good for a very solid reviewed shoe. I like to keep the shoe boxes to keep my shoes in this will not happen with this pair of shoes. Im hoping I get contacted by Brooks about this situation, cause there hasnt been many reviews I read with this happening and sure enough Im one of the few individuals that got the lucky draw. I heard good things about this shoe so I decided to give it a try. Took it for a run this morning, and boy was i impressed. It was very cushiony and soft inside, giving you a less impacted run. For those of you with joint problems, I think this could be the remedy if you want to keep an active lifestyle. Highly recommend this shoe"	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Ghost-11/dp/B077NGYXHR?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D4Q2RFF&psc=1

I went to an Under Armor store recently and the fantastic salesperson let me in on how UA makes their shoes. So you want to buy a shoe that is half a size to a size bigger. Hope this is helpful. I love UA but this one is in its own league. Not only it has a really thick cushion, its light and chic. I must warn interested runners that you may need to go 1/2 size to a size bigger. I wear 9 but this was tight even as 9.5, but since its a free return, I got size 10. Its a bit spaceous but good for hiding stash of money. Okie now that you know where I hide my allowance I must change the hide place buhahaha Great shoe that fits well and performs well. I am a heavier runner and these provide neutral support and comfort for longer runs. Very happy with them. Lucky I read the reviews first before buying. I'm a US9.5(Asics Kayano/Adidas pure boost) but I bought US10 for this pair instead and it fits great. There is a gentle arc for the feet which I like. THE GOOD:
EXTREMELY comfortable shoes for the $65 price. I think I will go back to Nike where 10.5 has never failed me no matter if they are a running, basketball, or street shoe. These shoes are great. They fit perfect on my foot, not too tight and not too loose. I bought my first pair at academy and then they became my favorite pair of workout shoes so I went ahead and bought the black ones for when these wear out. I will say I normally wear a 9.5 but for some reason i wear a size 9 in these other than that theyre great. And no these arent womens shoes regardless of what it says when you click on it lol. These are incredibly comfortable. I really love them. They just fit my feet though. I have been wearing them for a week now and I don't feel much pain in my feet, which is amazing for a running shoe. I will definitely buy these again..just one size larger. Nice shoe. Fits well. Slight rubbing on back heel where the top of the rear of the shoe meets the Achilles.

I have 135+ miles on them so far, so consider this an initial impression review. The fit is very similar in length and toe-box. I love the included elastic 'laces'. I generally skip laces and go with a 3rd party elastic. The support feels similar, i.e. minimal. If they hold up and continue to do well, I'll pickup another pair for rotation. I'm a fan of On and like these very much. My initial impression has held up, they aren't quite as light and airy as the Cloudracers, but I'll take the added support an a slightly larger drop. I appreciate the included stretch laces, big toe box. They are a nice balance for me. They are extremely comfortable and easy to slip on with or without socks, I suggest socks otherwise theyll probably get pretty stinky over time. These are also perfect for treadmill running. All in all a very good shoe for road running and treadmill running. I will definitely get another pair in the future . I loved these so much that I bought a pair of the navy blues, but the mesh on those ended up being a softer tech-mesh that is more like the gym-short material typical of other brands of running shoes. On the other hand, when the gray and orange pair caught on something, their more durable mesh material did not tear all the way through. Even as the shoes have worn out, there are small holes but they don't continue to tear and get bigger like the softer mesh does. Most comfortable shoes I've owned. I walk a lot, and I have no problem paying top dollar for a pair of shoes IF they feel good and provide adequate support. I have bought a lot of expensive shoes, and some are great, but none compare to the comfort of my On Cloud sneaker. They're not water repelling and can get easily wet in a mild shower, and it's true, they pick up pebbles like magnet. Again, the comfort level and traction support is the best I've experienced. I typically wear a 9 (or size 42.5 in EU) and these fit perfectly. I like the as they are. This fit as a 9.5 (yes i realize the review has been posted as a size 8 not sure why), so they may run a tad large for some, however i feel they fit me as expected. The shoe has been really fantastic so far, have used it nearly everyday - and it continues to offer superior comfort even as the 'stamp' on the individual clouds are disappearing. They've held up pretty well so far, would recommend them. On's price was a bit out of my comfort zone, so - i was able to purchase the red/flash pair last year during the year end sale for $50 (roughly). I did buy a second pair somewhat recently for about $80 (roughly) on Amazon at some ungodly morning hour, just an FYI to always check on the prices at different times of the day if you're considering this shoe. Additionally you may want to contact On's customer service to inquire when the next iteration of the shoe is due out, which may coincide with purging of old stock/models currently being sold (this is what i'm told happened late last year)."	https://www.amazon.com/ON-THECLOUD-Mens-Cloud/dp/B00YYEALA2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B015CR9XJ4&psc=1

I just finished a few 5Ks in this one and they are so comfortable. They kept true to the design. They still fit well and make for a good running shoe. I had the meniscus in my left knee removed when I was younger, and these shoes allow me to keep running without my knee reminding me of my past. These are a little softer than the previous two models that I have tried and I very much appreciate that as I am using them for training for and running marathons.

This part I appreciate. This is the 1st snug fit running shoes Ive ever worn. I guess the snug fit only works because of the Flyknit material can expand.

4/30/2018 UPDATE: After using the Ghost 10 for almost a month and logging almost 200 miles of power walking (I am not a runner) I have to say these are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned. Like them so much I ordered a second pair to alternate between sneakers. Went to Academy Sports and spent a lot of time searching for the right sneaker in a wide-width with no success. Really loved the fit and stability of the Brooks Ghost 10 and bought a pair. After 10+ fast walking sessions I am a believerthese sneakers provide great support and stability. Grantedthey may cost a bit more but the comfort is well worth the additional cost versus suffering with sneakers that do not fit well. Highly recommend these sneakers. I've had the Ghost 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 and the 10s are by the far the best. It seems with every new model they swing between a more inline, cushier sole and a wider, more ridged one, and the upper swings between materials focused on durability vs. comfort -- each new Ghost is a different combination along those 2 spectrums. This time I think Brooks hit the sweet spot. The sole is sturdy and comfortable yet doesn't seem as bulky as with the 9. The upper feels high-grade but is also incredibly soft and comfortable. It's like running in a moisture-wicking slipper. I also like the new design. The first time I put them on, I felt as though my feet had sprouted angels wings as they so delicately carried me around the track. Recently the shoe does not appear to fit as comfortably as it used to. I tried these for the first time based on reviews and it is by far one of the most comfortable, cushioning shoes with a decent arch support than I've ever ran in, in my entire life. I'm very happy with the support, the width, cushioning, and the toe box. Absolutely amazing. I'm running further and with much more Comfort than I have in many years. Purchased these as a gift for my boyfriend who knows and loves the Ghost style. Either way, if you're already a fan of the Ghost, this version will not disappoint. Running shoe color for us is usually a bonus, as we're more concerned with getting the best price and the right style, and often end up with some pretty hideous looking shoes. However, these are really nice. Probably the best looking shoe out of all the different pairs we own. I love running in these shoes after switching from my Mizuno Wave Rider 18 shoes. These really help cushion every step and help you glide through your run, and as someone who is 6'3"" & 230 lbs, cushioning is much appreciated. This is terribly disappointing because I had such hope for this shoe since it's excellent in every other aspect, but such an issue is significant to me. I can only hope that the heel material will hold out for a few months. I decided to give Brooks a try and I am happy I did. Quality of these shoes appears to be excellent, but time will tell. I still think shoes such as these are far overpriced for the materials/labor involved, but in relation to what's available these days for my specific needs, I can't complain too much. I under pronate and have fairly flat feet and these feel good to my wide feet. I've had some 2Es fit too narrow or too loose, but these fit me just perfect. So, if you try to stay in shoes that are more economically priced, but are making trade offs at the expense of getting proper fitting shoes, I highly recommend spending a bit more to do your feet, knees, and hips a favor."	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Ghost-10-Mens/dp/B072K719D4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BYJ6DP7&psc=1

I alternate between these and the 4s at my retail job and Im happy. They seem to fit my arch and give me just the right padding in the sole. This black pair I bought to wear to play golf. It was very comfortable to wear on the course. This shoes are awesome for running and super comfy. I do HIIT with them and don't have any problems. Really nice styling and wonderfully comfortable. My favorite shoe now. Second pair of shoes, same brand and type. bought online and shoe size matched perfectly. Love the color and the fit.

I have returned them for a size 12.5 to see if that corrects the mismatch between the feet, and makes a difference in overall comfort. I have been a big fan of Asics and I ran Marathon and Half Marathon races in previous models of Nimbus and they were fantastic (I gave a 5 star review on Nimbus 18). So I was very excited to order a new pair of Nimbus 20 to train and run for my upcoming Marathon this coming fall. When I put it on first time I felt the sole is stiffer than my older ones but I was thinking it will be fine. Well it might be because it needs some break-in even though I never experienced the same with my older nimbuses. I ran 3 more times, in between each run I had a break of a couple of days and I also ran in my old Nimbus 18 again to compare, every time my left heel hurts more after using this new model, but ok with 18. You have to opt for a 2E for a regular fit. May be the product manager responsible for this line at Asics has extremely narrow feet and thinks the entire world would appreciate the same. Due to all of the confusion on fit related to the Nimbus I checked with ASICS through chat and email. They gave me two different answers ( expert fitting support) so I ordered my regular fit size and a size larger that Asics suggested. Result; my regular fit was the correct one. Overall this ""new"" improved fit is comfortable and support is as good as older versions. They've taken away what I loved most about these shoes . . lots of padding in the soles and a large toebox (I ordered a wide). These look like my Nikes which cost me 1/3 as much. If I'm honest, most running shoes kind of feel the same to me. These shoes feel markedly more comfortable and supportive than anything I've owned in the past. Only reason they don't get five stars is that they don't give wide-size people any of the cool colors. Like walking/running on clouds... maybe thats where they get the Nimbus name. Have not been disappointed yet"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Nimbus-Trail-Running/dp/B071VRS34N?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07K1XPXTT&psc=1

Lightweight iBR+ bl""]"	"The Kinvara shoe has been around for nearly a decade, and I have seen it go through several iterations, some better than others. The recent trend has been toward more structure in the heel and midfoot, and more cushioning, while making the forefoot less structured and more flexible. It adds a more substantial, removable insole (no longer perforated, but adding some strength around the edges, thus cradling the foot a bit more). There is more padding and length in the tongue, and i believe the lacing system is a bit shorter (doesnt extend as far toward the toe of the shoe), thus giving the forefoot a roomier, more flexible feel. The heel cup is better designed and snugger, with more padding around the rim. The outsole is more flexible, so that, with all the additional cushioning and structure, you still get great road feel and toe off. In effect, this upgrade remains true to the light and free mid-foot striking Kinvara idea, while providing a more substantial shoe. My legs feel great after a run. So good that this order is my second pair. Not a speed guy any more, but I still want to feel like running with my feet rather than my shoes, if you know what I mean, without wearing out my joints. These shoes just keep getting better for me. With a 4mm drop and neutral cushioning and support, these are my go to street runners. Other than that, I put over 300 miles on these and liked them so much I bought two more pair. My feet are quite finicky, but they've always been happy with Saucony. I'm really happy with the Kinvara 9's. The fit is cozy, so be warned that they run small, but if you're a Saucony fan you already knew that. I've always been partial to the mild grade, 4mm, but there's still plenty of cushion, but little to no play. The heel hugs nicely, but the toe box is a little constrictive (but my foot is a bit wide). It also made me happy is that they have the somewhat ""vanilla"" white/blue version of the shoe; I prefer a toned-down color palette. My first run in these was delightful. I don't do as many miles as I used to, but I enjoy every mile in these shoes. Ive now logged over 100 miles in these and I am very happy with them. I feel secure and light in these shoes. These are an upgrade for sure (although I will continue to wear my Cohesions, which I love, until they fall apart). Each design change has been fine. Overall, this is still a great shoe, but they changed something in the toe box. These ones fit more like the 7's than the 8's. Which for me, I found the 7's to be more comfortable for my foot. They are definitely lightweight, comfortable and so far durable. These are definitely a minimalist shoe; dont expect 3"" of cushion because it isn't there. I ran a marathon in the 7's so i was very pleased that the 9's very much mimic the 7's in terms of fit. My son loves saucony shoes. Sure should have been a discounted price then. It conforms nicely when laced and is very neutral. While light weight, they still have a surprising amount of cushion."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078PP8PX8/ref=asc_df_B078PP8PX81555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B078PP8PX8&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Then a friend suggested I try something radical. I need to do something nice for my buddy because these shoes, though costing less than a third of some other shoes I've purchased, actually leave my feet feeling less tired and achy than it's more expensive brethren. I strongly endorse these, and as an added bonus, I will say they fit well (although I always have to buy a full size larger than for dress shoes), and come in enough colors to satisfy nearly everyone. I use these mostly for walking, but I do some running and gym work in them as well. They are very comfortable, have the support I need, have held up well, and keep my feet feeling great, too. I like them my podiatrist likes them and they are reasonable. Read more Good shoes for moderate runner (I rack up about 800 miles/year which equates to 15-20 miles a week). The support is exactly what I needed and they took about 30 miles before I noticed a complete break in. Very happy with the quality of the shoe. It breathes well and support is good. It seems the manufacturer fell in love with the idea of ""sock fit"" a few years ago. Years ago, ASICS didn't have the problem. They are comfortable for my daily jog as I'm no longer a competitive runner. I have had arch support issues my whole life and am a big fan of ASICS running shoes. Both loved the shoes. My son has fairly large, wide feet so he appreciates a quality shoe that fits comfortably. My spouse used to wear mostly New Balance brand but I think these are his new favorite. He is super picky but he hasn't had one complaint. If you have a normal foot shape, and no biomechanical defects like overpronation or supination, these shoes will be perfect for you. I have wider feet that are wide in the mid-foot (not in the toes), and a Greek type of the foot, so these in 4E fit pefrectly. I had to return these because I bought a better different color and lower price from another seller. They are ,what they say: Everyday comfort. My feet felt like I was walking on burning coal at the end of the day, obviously because the materials are made for exactly for that everyday comfort. And as such , they are fine. I use them at home all the time, but not for work, because that is li like training.

Nike is tops in my book when it comes to athletic performance shoes and fit. Their wide sizes are perfect for me and they feel great on my foot as I run on the treadmill or outdoors. Please expand your wide sizes with the various color options. Very nice running shoes. So I got this pair (about 2 months ago) relying solely on Amazon reviews. And oh wow. Very light and comfortable shoes. The top of the shoe itself is not waterproof, so obviously you can't expect it to be your wading boots. I'm not sure if these are true Nike shoes. I bought these as a Valentine's Day gift for my husband and when they came in they seemed like very very cheap material, the Nike symbol was off.

Fits really well very comfortable, not so great in the rain or cold blowing air. After coming across these by accident and purchasing a pair at a local shoe outlet, I'm totally satisfied with its look and comfort.

Vegan friendly', 'Trailprotect pad for underfoot protection', 'Breathable mesh lining, Vibram TC5 outsole', 'Insole: 3mm, 3mm lugs', 'Stack heel or toe height is 0.45 inch. Trail protect pad offers underfoot protection']	"I've had the original Trail Glove, followed up by the Trail Glove 3. The first Trail Glove was the best. I did, however, grow to like and appreciate the Trail Glove 3. I like the changes they made to the shoe. The tongue, as opposed to being it's own separate piece, is now integrated into the shoe, so it's more like a flap. I like this new version of rugged tread on the sole, offered by the always reliable Vibram. Though style much of a worry for most, I think these are definitely the most attractive looking Trail Gloves yet. I got mine in Vertical and they look so nice I almost don't want to get them dirty. As always, I am incredibly pleased with this Merrell product and it will continue to be my athletic shoe of choice. For those who are interested in minimalist running, you can't go wrong here. I can't stress enough how awesome these shoes are. Walking around all day, no matter my environment or weather, I have really enjoyed wearing these Glove 4s. Even if they do tend to hold a strong odor, yet somehow dry very quickly. The MR00s were my favorite road shoe until they went out of production. These are my favorite trail shoe so far. As others have stated, the sole is a bit stiff for a ""minimalist"" shoe, but they are zero drop and the benefit of the stiffness is protection on rocky trails. I have bruised the balls of my feet, so I appreciate the sole-armor. The toebox is too small for me, but not uncomfortably so. It's probably fine for someone with a normal-width forefoot. My pinky toes get squeezed the most, but the rest are fine. I wish they made a version with road tread. Must say I enjoy them quite a lot. They fit nice and snug and are very comfortable. The grip is impressive which is why I went with these over other minimalist shoes that I checked out in stores. Was plesantly surprised with the cushioning in them coming from a parkour background finding shoes that can take long drops without murdering my foot is important. The shoes do have a little tag on that tells you how to run in them...lol.)

I like the choice in material almost feels like neoprene for the upper hugs the foot nicely and still breathes well. Vibram outsoles are always nice the tread pattern sheds mud and debris quickly while running to maintain grip. Would be a nice update for the 5 or 6. Even that being said the tears dont go through and are more like gashes. I've done a fair bit of extreme trailrunning with them (shown in video) they're superb in this element providing the grip to maintain proper footing. Overall I'm very pleased with them and would buy them/next gen again and would suggest them to someone looking for a comfortable minimalist shoe. I've recieved many compliments on them also but that could just be the color choice speaking. Good for all types of use from city skyline running life to backwood boulder jumping. Tip: Buy the exact size you wear they run true to size. Unlike the vapor glove(also tried on and looked at buying) which runs big due to lack of overall padding. similar sizing to shoes like converse. Read more I've been a fan of the Trail Gloves ever since the first version was released, and while i don't always run in minimal shoes, Trail Gloves are my go to shoes when i do. The new version 4 continues to be a great shoe, although it's a lot less minimal than the earlier versions. I like the new tongue design, and the outer material, as well as the new laces. Speaking of stiffness, the sole is very stiff, and you won't see people rolling up this shoe into a ball like with other minimal shoes. I am happy with the protection and traction, but the real test for the traction will be running on wet rocks. The fit is great, and my feet didn't get bruised running on technical trails full of rocks and roots.The blue color is great, and overall i am happy with the shoes. This shoe is not for someone looking for a true minimal shoe experience, but for me it fills the gap between the original Trail Glove and my Altra Lone Peaks."	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Trail-Glove-Runner/dp/B01MRXMEBT?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MV05STC&psc=1

Previous reviews showed that about 80% of people stated that it was true to size. Initial fit feels very comfortable. Toe box feels adequate with plenty of room. I don't think the looseness warrants going down in size though, so I'm glad that I stuck with the 8.5. The laces are thin, but I like the lacing system. Will have to see how well they hold up. The shoe is very comfortable. Looks very sharp as well. Grip was amazing. While I watched others slip and slide up and down the hill, I always felt like I had a great grip on the ground. Felt great. Love the lacing and tucking them under the tongue. I felt like the fit was great. Plenty of support, but also plenty of room in the toe box. Best part about the shoes is probably the grip. It was amazing. Overall, it held up extremely well. Read more These trail shoes fit snuggly at my chosen size 11. I could have gone with 11.5 on these easily. The toe box is just roomy enough to be okay for my runs. This shoe does have a decent responsiveness on trail and on asphalt as well. The foam gives some energy rebound. These are heavier than road shoes as expected but not bad by trail standards. The lacing system is very good. Overall, I am happy with the purchase as an all-around trail runner. First I really like these. I decided to where them to town and see if it got any better. After about an hour walking around they felt great. On every surface great traction. Very comfortable even on steep descents. The feel an asphalt surprised me. I even did a bit of boulder hopping and they excelled at that. I love these shoes. Beautifully made, rubber sole feels like it could climb over anything, great snug fit at heel. All in all this is a nice trail running shoe but it is very narrow. I had to return these shoes because they fit too tight. Lightweight and comfortable. The ability to quickly tighten the shoes is nice. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who needs a pair of turf shoes for softball. As an infielder mainly, playing on dirt in these is great, the traction is excellent. For me they are perfect and I will get them again if needed. I love Salomon gear, so this isn't a very objective review. Top notch for trail running. Love this shoe... Also, be very careful on wet cobblestone or slick concrete. The cleats can make it like ice. I recommend trying them out in person, before ordering online. The shoe looks great but the toe box is way too narrow. I bought these with hopes to hike Havasupai in July, but after testing them out a couple times on some of the local mountains, it's clear that these are going to smash my toes too much and not be qualified for a 20+ mile round trip hike	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-Speedcross-Trail-Runner/dp/B01HD5ZACC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CLNCH5B&psc=1

In the past week, I've also ran on my old Ultra Boost (750+ miles) as well as a new pair of Adidas Supernovas (which have essentially been rebranded as the Solar Boost, also about 10 miles). The reasons I like this shoe can be summarized in that they are cushiony, light but supportive enough for distance running, breathable, and look great. CUSHION-Y:
First, these shoes are in the Boost line-up, and utilize the same fantastic midsole characteristic of the line-up. This means they offer great support in hot or cold temperatures (which is great for my knees and ankles), offer great pop back to help spring you back forward for speed and energy efficiency, and can be used for short or long runs (I ran multiple marathon distance runs in my older Ultra Boosts). The Boost foam midsole on this shoe has literally revolutionized the running shoe industry in the last few years with how soft, supportive, and cushiony the shoes can be (I'm serious - look up Adidas Ultra Boost technology and or Adidas Boost PVU technology and see how many companies have since copied the technology). LIGHT BUT SUPPORTIVE ENOUGH:
I highly prefer these shoes to the original Ultra Boost, which do not offer enough lateral support for any cross-training type movements, and the Supernova/ Solar Boost, which are heavier and offer a cage that lock the foot-down even more but are like 20% heavier. I think these shoes are just supportive enough for road running, on paved surfaces in a straight line with no quick direction changes. BREATHABLE
I love the Adidas tech used for the uppers on these. Similar to the flyknit on the Ultra Boost, these are nice and breathable, but include a combination of several different fabrics and rubber lines to help lock the foot down. STYLISH::
Your mileage may vary, but I love the way these sea-greenish colored shoes look. I think Adidas is definitely winning the style game, if you care about that kind of thing
Read more My son loved these shoes when we got them. They were his favorite among all other sdidas options. Well the toe room was great but when I walk in them my ankle bone hits the edge. Light, springy, silly colors -- I like the total package these shoes offer. I enjoy it. With 150 miles on it I am pleased with the responsiveness. Great in the winter, however.

A bit pricey, but to me, well worth it because of the comfort. The title of this review pretty much sums up my experience with this shoe. But to expand a bit, this is without a doubt the most comfortable and supportive running shoe I've bought in years. I'm an avid 3-4 mile a day outdoor power walker (with a few short sprints thrown in during walk) and exercise on a combination of sidewalk, street and packed gravel, and was having difficulty finding a shoe that would provide my aging feet and particularly right ankle sufficient support. Previously I used Asics Nimbus and Kayanno shoes and loved them, but the past several years I found them to be increasingly lighter weight at the expense of providing sufficient support. So I decided to shop around and after pretty extensive research bought these NB shoes. Glad I did. But they retain enough mesh to provide great breathing and minimize heat, while providing the lighter weight. These shoes have a suade looking leather with the mesh which looks great as well. An added bonus, and in fact I bought another pair to kick around in for casual wear. They shoes come up slightly higher on the ankle than my Asics did - about to the lower level of the ankle joint which for me is perfect. Also they provide great heal support. Of course as normal with all shoes of this type, dumping the junk insoles that come with the shoes and replacing with a good insole is a must to maximize comfort and support. I personally wear fitted orthonics, but certainly not a must for most people. The soles are a bit stiff feeling compared to previous shoes, but I like this as well, as that is what helps provide the extra support. Overall, this a superbly designed and constructed shoe and a great buy for the price. Read more I've only been wearing these V4s for about 4 days but so far they're great. Good lateral support, very comfortable. With these shoes on there is an enormous improvement. So, one can look at a good running shoe not only as a sporting shoe but also as a highly effective protective measure for older people who walk for their exercise. Super. Loved the sneaker. The original pair were/are very comfortable, and they worked well with my cane. Now I don't need the cane anymore and the sneakers still work great. They don't seem to miss the cane either. They fit as well as my original pair, but they don't have all the character lines or stains yet. So, if you need a pair of comfortable ""sneakers"", these New Balance Men's M990GL4 Running Shoes by New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc are highly recommended by this Arizona retiree. Very comfortable shoe. The ones that look ok and I settle on have given me heel spurs. So I decided on these because they're made in America and have never heard bad things. Reviews were helpful too so that eased the pain in parting with so much money. After a day of wearing, I ordered another pair because you never know when they will take a good shoe off the market these days and wrap it in Styrofoam for $100+ so you buy more and faster."	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-M990-Mens-990v4/dp/B075DB1QJ2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07P38NTSX&psc=1

I told a friend of my mine my problems and he told me to look at my shoes. I starting looking into shoes that would support my somewhat flat fleet but also support my knees. They are worth every penny. I have been running since the 1980s, it is a passion and a excellent form of exercise,
This being said, shoes are so critical to performance and ability to maintain long term running ability. From the moment I received them, even up to writing this review, have I ever never known a more perfect fit in design, sizing, style, quality and over all excellent feeling out of a shoe. I highly recommend you try these, especially if your a serious runner. I've owned many different Brooks shoes, however, these are the most comfortable and supportive by far. I would definitely give them a try and see for yourself. I decided to try the Adrenaline GTS 19 because I like Brooks shoes and they recommend them for walking and running. They are very comfortable and I enjoyed them on my first walk (3 miles) yesterday. They are definitely more cushioned than Ghost, so if you like feeling more of the pavement, these probably aren't for you. I am very pleased I chose Adrenaline GTS 19 for my new walking shoes I came from the GTS 18 and I thought that shoe was amazing and couldn't get much better.....I was wrong. You can't go wrong at all with these shoes. I ordered these in 9.5 and they are a perfect fit. a prior pair of addictions i had to order in a 10. so go at least a half size up I just received these today. The Amazon recommended size for me, which was 9.5 (this is my standard shoe size in most things) was way small... just opening the box I said to myself, these dont even look 9.5. Im giving a 3 star for now cause apart from the size I really like them and am exchanging for the next size up. If happy when the new size comes I will update review!

*Updated to 5 Stars*
Firstly, kudos to amazon for re shopping me the correct size so quickly. Secondly, now that I have these in the correct size I have to admit they are probably the most comfortable, supportive and cushioned running shoes Ive owned. Highly recommend. Liked these shoes so well I bought a second pair in another color a few days later. This is without a doubt the most comfortable athletic shoe I've ever worn. I bought them to use as a walking shoe, however I enjoy the wonderful feel and support so much that I am wearing them every day, all day ,except when the occasion calls for a different style or color of shoe. I don't have enough experience with them yet to talk about how they will hold up, but they appear to be well made and my wife has two pair of similar Brooks athletic shoes and has walked many miles in them and they look like new."	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Adrenaline-GTS-19/dp/B07C6P6P4Z?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D3FTNC6&psc=1
25	25	Saucony Guide ISO	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'EVERUN topsole', 'ISOFIT dynamic upper', 'Engineered mesh', '', '']	I know everyone's feet are different but I have had great luck with Saucony running shoes. I bought the 13W and they are very comfortable. I'm not a runner but I wear these to work and the comfort lasts all day. They also help slightly to turn my out, so I don't walk as flat footed as usual. I was really surprised how shoddily these shoes seem to be made, appear to be really cheap materials. They look like they were put together with stickers and a laser printer. Was a longtime Brooks runner, then switched to Saucony because I liked their combination of light weight / support. I love the comfort and feel of this shoe. I needed the Wide fit to accommodate my orthotic inserts. The shoes are lightweight and Amazon offered such a great deal on the price, I ordered 3 pair. The shoes were shipped for free and arrived within 4 days. They fit like a glove and were priced way below the price at local stores. Thank you Amazon. We ordered these shoes in August and less than three months later, they look like they're over a year old. This is my son's seventh pair of Saucony shoes, and up until now we were satisfied. They seem like seconds. Excellent cushion and stability. Ran in them right out of the box and they were great. Can't really tell the difference between these and the Ride 10s but doesn't matter, they're both excellent hard pavement shoes. Fits fine. They are a little bit more cushioned than I would have liked. I've been a Saucony Guide fan (series 5-9) for years now. The construction is tremendously cheaper, although still comfortable. About the same time I purchased the IOS's, I also bought the Mizuno Wave Inspire 13's. The Mizuno's have a slightly harder sole, but they are an extremely well built and comfortable shoe, plus the slightly wider toe box is an advantage. Bought the ISO Guide for casual wear. Great for walking, as they are very comfortable. Highly recommend.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Guide-Running-Shoe/dp/B071G376P5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MV6QYNK&psc=1

They were so great that I wore them daily for near 3 years until they practically disintegrated. When I finally had to give them up, I was convinced Merrell would deliver another quality product so I went straight for these. The color and design are nice, really eye-catching. Lots of compliments from people never having seen them before and asking about where I got them. Lightweight and comfortable for people who like shoes that don't offer much support. When I first opened them up, I was surprised to see visible glue seams that bond the upper and sole together on the exterior of the material. They are prominent on both shoes and are really unsightly if anyone takes more than a passing glance at your feet. Getting past that, I have to say that I was not a fan of the fit at first, but this is comparing them to the earlier version I owned. As a stand alone shoe the comfort is acceptable. To my (not so much) surprise, after about 3 months of semi-daily use they did start to fall apart - but not at the seams. The material ripped wide open in the middle of the fabric! (On both shoes) What kind of cheap material is this that it can't withstand daily walking? (I don't run in these, only occasionally wear them to work and gym) I know some people will think it is because I have wide feet but I definitely do not. I'm a standard size and have had a few pairs of custom dress shoes made so I know my measurements well. The earlier gloves I owned were so comfortable and well made that I really thought I'd be wearing this brand the rest of my life. Oh well, on to the next one. Read more I really enjoy the feel of moving in the Vapor Glove 3's. The lack of hardly any material between you and the ground makes me feel more planted, not to mention has greatly increased the strength of my ankles and knees. The same thing began to happen on the left shoe as well in approximately the same place (towards the front where the shoe creases to allow your toes to bend up). I very much want to like these shoes, as I'm happy with my performance in them, but this type of shoddy quality was not what I expected in a higher-end trail runner. If Merrell fixes this problem I will gladly give the Vapor Gloves another chance, likely in a size 12.5 for a better fit. These too are tearing just like the 2 pairs of VG 2's I have. I like the idea of these shoes but as for their execution as they are constructed .... well .... I'm all for it. ! ;-)

--------------------------------------------
So far so good. Yes, they are a few mm's thicker than the Vapor Glove 2, but in my case wearing them in a cold climate I find that my feet don't feel the cold quite as much, so okay for now. But please Merrell, don't make them any thicker than these as then they'd no longer be as flexible and supple, which is the purpose of the Vapor Glove shoes in the first place. These are not unlike but a few available shoes currently, and that's a wonderful thing . I do like these very much . Too early to comment on durability and the effectiveness of the reinforcements.(see above)
Read more I thought the Vapor Glove 2's were good. All I can say is, wow. These are the best running and workout shoes I've ever owned. These shoes are legitimately amazing. Please don't break down your joints and ankles by jumping into minimalist shoes without starting slow, from what I hear lots of people try the trend and leave their huge padding behind and tear themselves up. My stride is much, much quieter and softer than my friend that uses thick-soled shoes. Makes me feel like I am running on clouds. Having had numerous pairs of previous vapor gloves 1 & 2's, I was really looking forward to the improvements durability wise on these, unfortunately turns out to be their downfall"	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Vapor-Glove-Trail-Runner/dp/B01NBWQU9D?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MV2N9ZS&psc=1

The shoes fit the same as the ""17""s but the cushioned performance is much different. My comparison was done with a second pair of ""17""s bought on Amazon 28 months ago but not yet used. The gel-cumulus 18 were the only running sneakers I trusted. I was hesitant to try the 20s but after receiving these sneakers and putting about 10 miles the first week I'm amazed at how great of a job Asics did with this upgrade. The fit is great, and for anyone like me who's pinky always manages to poke a hole in sneakers this version seems to have some extra material from the toe cap that wraps over to the outside. Overall great pair of sneakers. Everything that related to delivery was excellent. The package, the delivery time and the service was excellent. Kayan was good and so on, the best was nimbus. The size came fine, and very much liked the color and material, but the model structure is very tight for my foot. Sorry for bad review. what i disliked was spending hours resourcing what type of shoe to by aand these come back as one of the top brands for comfort and stability for heavier set people that walked on the side of the feet these shoes were supposed help correct this issue but didnt work well and the cushioning in these shoes sucked from the start so pretty much wasted $120 on shoes will never buy again This is probably the most comfortable running shoe that I've owned. This keeps my heel from rubbing and keeps my feet from feeling weighed down. These shoes also look really good. But when I opened the box, I was very pleased with their appearance. They are great for running, but also understated so I can really wear them anywhere for anything that isn't super-formal. These running shoes fit as expected. Remember for running shoes to fit perfectly wear a size larger. This pair of ASICS Gel-Cumulus 20 SP Men's Running Shoe are comfortable and light. My husband loves these shoes. He says they're comfortable, with all day foot support. He really likes the color of this bright blue pair."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Cumulus-Running-Shoes/dp/B07BWVSSXM?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07DGVHYBG&psc=1

Another good shoe from ASICS. I've been wearing Gel-Ventures for a few years now, and these Sonomas measure up nicely. I don't run anymore so I can't speak to that, but they're great for walking. The DM's are tighter than other ASICS, but i have a narrow foot so it's OK with thin socks. If you like to wear thick socks, maybe you should size up. They are sturdy and solid with good tread life. I think perhaps this style/model was miscast as a runner and should have been marketed as an everyday shoe for active lifestyles. Fantastic for biking, stair climbing though. Would like top of toe of shoe covered like they use to be. I don't know why that was removed from the shoe, it protected my
toes and the toe of the shoe. Asics shoes always fit me good, they are very comfortable. I use them for treadmill, elliptical and general strength training in the gym. I got my regular size 9 medium width and they fit good. These are great shoes that help with my supination. They're a bit snug, but I decided to hang with them and they're better after a few months, but still a bit snug. Would definitely order a wide or half size up next time, otherwise it would be 5 stars They came out of the box laced very tightly. Once I adjusted the lacing and wore them for about a week they feel great. I have these in grey and wanted another color because they are so comfortable for me. What i love best is their breathability. Just be careful they dont do so well keeping your feet dry in the rain."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Sonoma-Running-Shoe/dp/B01N8WTJ7I?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0764NVYHZ&psc=1
32	2	Altra Escalante	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Ideal uses: running, racing, training', 'Designed to improve: Running Form, Toe Splay, Stability, Push-off, Comfort, Traction', 'Zero drop platform, stack height: 25mm', 'Weight: 8.2 oz', 'Responsive Altra Ego midsole']	"And I will say that these offer some pretty good protection while on the road or on the trails. I was a fan of the Altra One's which are shoes with the least protection and was a big fan so these were almost on par with those shoes. Pros:

1) The protection is great. Coming from Vibram fivefinger shoes, this protection is a blessing. I know the true hardcore minimalist runners will balk at all this protection but when you are putting alot of mileage in one day, I welcome the fact that feet are not as sore.

2) They conform to your feet well. These shoes allows your toes to naturally spread for proper form and gives you ample opportunity to correct your running form.

3) These shoes are light. I had the opportunity to be on the trails during a storm and it was pretty muddy. It was around 15 degrees F, and typically that would not bother me but I did not have any winter socks. My feet were pretty cold that day. I recommend winter socks if you are running in the cold.

2) For forward foot strikers (like myself), these don't offer that much stability so you will need excellent posture and strong feet/ankle muscles otherwise you are going to end up sore. This is where vibram's fivefingers come out ahead.

3) The shoe laces are pretty short so I only get to tie it with one knot. Well, almost every run, one or both shoes comes untie. I recommend ditching the laces for ""No Laces"".

4) Last but not least, the pricing is pretty high. I typically buy my gym shoes through road runners since I am on the family VIP and could have saved 15 bucks but I really wanted these shoes so I can go out running. Spending that much money in a short amount of time is not going to sit well with the wife. I hope this all helps those who are pondering these shoes. I will say I tried the new balance foam models and these altra's are far better. But then again I am biased since these shoes promote proper and natural running style. Anyone else experiencing this issue as well. Purchased these and my feet seriously never hurt anymore, they have a wide toe area which just seems to allow your foot to flex and breath unlike most shoes. These are the priciest pair of shoes I think I've ever purchased but totally worth the cost because I won't need a new pair for quite a while. I also had not heard of this brand but super impressed and will buy again in the future. I had already bought a pair of the same brand at my doctor's office that was heavenly to walk in, especially after toenail surgery. They're shaped like human feet (wide at the toes). I'd been trying to get my husband to try them with no success. As a last resort, I bought a red pair online as a gift. He started running again every day and keeps praising the shoes. I wouldn't spend this amount of money on clothes or purses but comfortable shoes are not a luxury. The fit was great - I loved the extra room in the toe box. At first they felt like I was running on a cloud... but that soon changed. Despite this difficulty, I pushed through - stopping to stretch when I felt tight - and kept racking up the miles. I've only had these shoes for a couple of days, and I'm here to tell you that straight out of the box these are THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I'VE EVER PURCHASED!. As a Fitness Professional (Personal Trainer) for over 12 years now (who is REALLY into workout shoes), I've pretty much tried out just about EVERY brand and most styles of fitness shoes out there. Including some of my favorites being Brooks, Addidas, Under Armour, Rebok, and most recently Topo Magnify!. The fit was perfect, with plenty of room for my toes to wiggle and do what toes are supposed to do. As I said, I've only had them for a couple of days, but my sense is these are going to be my most favorite fitness shoes to date. This is a great feeling shoe. It's very comfortable right out of the box. Also, they're comfortable for a long run"	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Escalante-Running-Shoe/dp/B01HNL24M0?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BNBYKG8&psc=1

That info is here because I'm the kind of guy that Saucony targets with the Triumph series. These shoes have kept me largely injury free, and I can generally say I see improvement with just about every new model they bring out. The 4 is interesting, the traction grips on the bottom are all linear and front back directional compared to the older models which cross from side to side. Traction is excellent and I'm currently breaking them in. These are the best shoes I have ever owned, I'm on my feet a lot every day and these cover all aspects of the shock I typically get from walking or even running. Read more These shoes are great. I'm a larger runner at 195 lbs and these shoes have great cushioning. To that end, I would love to see mileage posted by each person who submits comments. This allows the buyer to understand how well the shoe is made and the life expectancy of the shoe. Read more I have bought every successive version of the Saucony Glide shoes, these were the next version. I wish I could find the words, but my feet feel more cramped and less comfortable than in the older versions. You may want to try them at a local shoe place before buying them, or be prepared to send them back if you order then online. So far, they seem fine, although I really wanted soles that were less stiff than are in both pairs of sneakers. Ill probably wait a couple of months, and then see if I can some with softer and more flexible soles. The last one was ISO 2, and this is much better, snug fit. Wish they improve on the fabric. Was very happy with them and got used to them. These are much lighter, seem (not by fit but by bulk) much smaller on my feet. But wow, serious support and great cushioning. So far they are holding up well to the wear of a 170 pounder power walking alongside a scenic highway. Shoe fits well.

Also, the ""black"" fabric on these is on the blue side when outside or under bright light, but they're still good and I'm so glad I bought these. I wear a women's 8 but they were sold out in the women's black so I bought a men's 6.5; perfect fit.

Read more Non-gimmicky training shoe that impressed me on the first run. It doesnt feel natural. These shoes allow me to just run without any forced form changes. Granted I have only completed one 5 mile run but the difference was notable. I have also had plantar fasciitis and I forgot to move my arch supports from my last pair of shoes. Still felt great. Plenty of support. Also worth mentioning that I only use them for running and I run on a gym treadmill except for road races. I run on roads in the hills so periodic replacements are important. The sales person said that's a really popular size, which is why they're always sold out. Since I know my Nike size (a half size larger than my regular shoes), I didn't have any worries about size, just the cushion that would be available with the new shoes. These shoes have great cushion without being mushy and have been a joy for recent runs, although I should note I always add a reasonably thin, store-bought cushion to my running shoes.

38	8	Asics Gel Kayano 24	"['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', ""I.G.S (Impact Guidance System) Technology: ASICS design philosophy that employs linked componentry to enhance the foot's natural gait from heel strike to toe-off."", 'FlyteFoam Midsole Technology: insert info here', 'Fluid Ride Midsole: Fluid Ride provides the ultimate combination of bounce back and cushioning properties with reduced weight and exceptional durability.', '', '']"	"He needs shoes that provide both a lot of cushion in the heel area and structured heel support, and he also needs new shoes at least every 6 months. The Asics Gel-Kayano (plus SmartFeet inserts) is by far the best shoe for his needs, and has been his go-to everyday shoe for years. Unfortunately, the Gel-Kayano 23 model (and earlier models) came in pretty hideous colors for everyday wear. He's a professor, so he needs to look professional at work, and the 23 model didn't have a single option that worked well for that. The least obtrusive seemed to be the silver and blue model, and they aren't exactly high fashion--the main fabric is shiny silver with bright blue laces and reflective-shiny blue bands all over it. Imagine those shoes with chinos, a nice shirt, and a tweed jacket. He also felt a bit self conscious wearing those shoes when we went to nice restaurants or other fancy events where all the other men were wearing dress shoes. In contrast, we are so happy with the new styles available with the Gel-Kayano 24. The fit, comfort, and support are the same excellent quality that he has come to count on from Asics Gel-Kayano, and this time they seem to have hired a better designer, because there are a few options that actually look good too. We got the black/charcoal, and they look great!. The matte finish is a nice touch. They are classy & unobtrusive enough for him to wear to work every day & still look very professional. They are wonderful for my husband's day-to-day pain management. And instead of being stressed out every 6 months hoping to find a decent pair of shoes, we just re-order these and are good to go. I highly recommend Gel-Kayanos for anyone who needs extra heel support & cushion, especially now that the 24s have the improved color options. Lastly, I have a message for the Asics design people: If you have anyone reading these reviews, please learn from this. I'm sure runners are fine with the bright, shiny colors, because maybe it makes them feel safe, and either way, they only have to wear them for like an hour a day. Please always make sure to provide a more subtle, sober, professional option for those with foot injuries etc. who need your shoes for everyday wear. Thank you!. The ASICS Mens Gel-Kayano 24 Running Shoe was on 3 of the ""Best Runners for Plantar Fasciitis"" lists I found on the web. Along with his orthotics, I though this was a sure thing. He was excited to get them and wanted to love these shoes. Unfortunately, I believe the Gel Kayano *previous* versions may have been great for Plantars, but this version is NOT.

The sizing was spot on for him, he found the uppers to be very comfortable, he loved the responsiveness, breathability and flexibility of the shoe (he runs midfoot strike as recommended by his therapist) and the seemingly ultra light weight compared to the various Saucony's he's been wearing for years. These shoes, touted as 'cushiony and energizing' were anything but, especially for a person with plantars. I gave these 4 stars (subtracted 1 star because they are not ""cushiony"" as described) because if you are not suffering foot injuries or have Plantars, this is a great shoe for those who like a lightweight shoe and appreciate that 'road feel' contact when they run but do not expect much in the way of cushiony soles. These shoes have always worn out a little sooner than expected, but have been comfortable from the beginning to the end. Seriously, they are the most comfortable running and cross-training shoes that I've EVER worn. Stability is unparalleled, and they fairly light given the superb support. After a few months, the 23's are still holding up well and going strong... but I've retired them to ""running around the city"" shoes (I live on the UWS in Manhattan) because they are just so damn comfortable. But you can run in them comfortably 4-EVER. Wish the price would come down but, hey, you only get one pair of feet in life. Be good to them. They will definitely thank you with these shoes."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Kayano-24-Running-Shoes/dp/B01MXE1LIO?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B072Q1QBVL&psc=1

Nice soft comfort with low road noise. The shoe is light and very comfortable. I wear size 11.5 narrow, and these fit perfect. That is probably due to the fact that I have not broken them in yet. I hope to get about 6 months use out of these shoes or about 600 miles. But so far so good. They are all happy with the running shoes as well. With this pair of Brooks, it feels like I'm running on the backs of unicorns that are flying in the clouds. I have enjoyed running in the Ravenna for probably 10 years. This version is great, everything is improved. Better knot upper that holds my foot without rubbing my skin or pressing on my toenails, if you run a lot youll understand. Not trusting a new version, I got one pair just for casual wear since the look pretty decent for a running shoe. Very comfortable for walking, even hours of walking. Most importantly, they feel great to run in. Responsive yet cushioned. I can feel everything but nothing feels too bad, even landing on rocks is tolerable. Free speed...definitely easier to run faster than the previous version. These are without a doubt the best running sneakers I've run in, period. If you love running long and hard, then look no further. I have been a NewBalance fan for years because of the comfort for just being on my feet, not so much for running or even walking long distance in. Of course ellipticals are boring as all get out even when you watch the wall mounted TV.

So I get the bright idea to finally get some real running shoes. I Google some reviews I come across some high praise for different Brooks shoes - which got me interested in the Brand. Was this the perfect shoe for me. I still have some pain on the top ball of my foot, but it's far more manageable than ever before and this gives me some hope. These shoes are fantastic!!. Update .... if youre buying these sneakers for foot support to help with overpronation .... forget about it .... they redesigned this sneaker very poorly....they are beyond horrible....what a disappointment....so pissed .

The toe box is a little wide for my foot, but I have tightened them up and seriously, I love these shoes. So SO happy I finally did. They wear well, fit true to size...not too loose or tight. Thus far the Brooks Glycerin 15s offer better support, more balanced cushioning and a great bounce response when I do run. In Texas heat these shoes offer great air flow and I can literally wear these all day long without over heating my feet. They run great then the soles of the shoe just fall off. They are an even better shoe. They are extremely well cushioned. The feel like walking on air. They provide excellent support. I would recommend that you buy these without any hesitation. Best, most comfortable shoes I have ever worn; no kidding. It's kinda like strapping on tempurpedic pillows to your feet.

Regarded as one of the best running shoes released this year, I bought a second pair on Amazon because 1/2 sizes are tough to find and Amazon is the only place I could find a 12.5. I owned a previous pair of size 13 that fit very well. I have tried my best to beat the crap out of these shoes, I just cant do it. Not sure what makes these so special but whatever formula adidas used to make these, they need to spread across the rest of their running line. I LOVE THIS model and will buying as many pairs as I can before they arent around anymore. Perfect fit, it feels like wearing slippers, which is quite unusual compared to previous shoes. The boost effect is actually felt while running. But the first impression is very positive My husband loves these. He went to a local running store and this is the pair said worked best with his stride etc... however they wouldn't price match with Amazon so he left the store and I ordered on line. He loves them. These sneakers are light weight and nice looking. They are $160 shoes , but I waited , as I always do , until they were reduced , in price , on Amazon. Im very satisfied with the shoes.

All and all these shoes feel and fit better than other products that I have tried on before and I always make the family guy ""round-house"" joke but say ""Road-Hawks"" instead. Makes for a silly joke but I'm the winner in the end due to being able to outpace a majority of people I'd jog with when I couldn't before due to uncomfortable shoes not letting me push the pace. The Roadhawk has been (unofficially) designated as the successor of the Excel 33. Although the total heel height of the Roadhawk is higher than the Excel, the drop is less (8mm vs. 10mm) and the weight is slightly less (8.6 oz. vs. 8.9 oz). There are two significant differences for me (after going through three pairs of the Excel): The toe box of the Roadhawk is narrower, which is okay because I have a narrow foot. The comfort of the knit upper and subtlety of the logo treatment are positives for me. I wore a 10.5 in the Excel. Overall, the Roadhawk is okay, but I can't give it a 5-star rating. I miss my Excel 33s. Comfort wise, they're great. It was on a non-mossy pavement 2 hrs after rain fell, so the traction should have held up a lot better than that. So either I was lucky enough to get a dud or the stitching material is sub-par. Love these shoes: they fit well (little bit on the small side as compared to my Saucony's and Hoka's), very very light, breath well, don't give me blisters. Comfortable, but they fell apart just after the return window closed. It's hard for me to find a pair of black Asics that I like it. I love these Asics because they are not their typical bright, crazy loud colors. I love the different textures, it make this pair really unique. They fit quite well too.

Asics has many other fine shoes. I ran in GT-2000s and GT-3000s for years, and was also very happy with Nimbus. I'd say the fit is true. All went well. The shoes provide a good balance of cushion and spring. Low profile, well-made and stylish enough to make me smile.

Theyre ok. Look better on pictures I've worn Asics trail running shoes for 17 years and I run 20 to 25 miles a week.

Waterproof: A true waterproof shoe, I ran in rain and hit a lot of puddles, also just wore around town in the rain. No water touched my feet, excellent waterproofing. Look and feel: Excellent look, feel comfortable just walking. They are going to require a lot of breaking in before they are comfortable but i suspect once you do they will be very comfortable. I definitely wouldn't do any long hikes or runs without breaking them in early. Spend a good 10-15 miles breaking these in before you try and put them to the test. I'd recommend these shoes for short wet hikes or runs on trail only, or just for a waterproof shoe to wear in the rain. These were definitely not made for hard surface running. I wear a standard width sneaker and I'd like it if these had been just a little on the wider side like my Brooks or New Balance shoes. The shoe is very tight at first but after several days use it feels like a tight good fit. It will definitely need a break-in period. The grip below doesn't appear to be well suited for hard concrete. The shoe definitely has good waterproof material with the goretex. I recommend it best suited for all-weather dirt trails. This is a great shoe if you like a taller, more narrow heal. Otherwise: the tread is GREAT for loose dirt, snow and ice because of the pattern, and the softer rubber. And the waterproof fabric performs well. Love the speedcross but not this one. I cannot wash them clean and my 1 month old shoes look like theyre 2 years old. Fact is that Ive loved my other speedcross shoes so much that I still have them after 2 years even though the sole is completely gone. And they look cleaner than the lime green gtx I just bought!!. Wish I could get my money back on these ones. Amazon was wonderful with the return of the shoes. They stay looking clean and there is no popping sound. Thank you Amazon. Salomon speedcross 4 are the best trail shoe available. This is my second pair and Im sure there will be more pair in the future. This shoe has the comfort, flex, grip and rigidity life better than any other trail shoe I have owned."	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Speedcross-Trail-Running-Shoes/dp/B07CZWM35L?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01J23V8HE&psc=1

Wouldn't use these for longer runs but works well for walking, gym sessions or casual to moderate running. The tongue could be improved to something thicker/ more substantial. They have the same boost tech in the more expensive Adidas running shoes. First off let me say I am not a runner so I really cant tell you what these are like for running I can tell you they are squishy like boosts should be. I am a huge fan of adidas (nike who?) I've tried the cloud foam, the pure bounce, the rocket boost, which were the best and I cant find them anymore so these are the next best I tried. The insole and inner structure of this show has ZERO arch support. However, I'm flat-footed so this does not bother me. So far, this shoe is very light, comfortable, breathable, and aesthetically pleasing. Looking from the top down, you will see that the sole extends well beyond the upper. The sole is basically a responsive-bounce wedge bound to your feet by fly-knit like fabric. This is a total winner for me. I've ran in Asics (a strong favorite), Nikes (80% were terrible), and Solomon (best trail-running shoes). These are outstanding for daily city runs. You might talk to someone with a high or medium arch who has these to see if they like them. I now own 6 pairs because they are the best running shoe/every day shoe Ive ever walked/ran in. If it wasnt for that the shoe would be great. Its comfortable. I dont know quite how to describe the fit of this. Idk, Ill play around with the lacing and maybe thatll fix things Love these, insanely light and comfy. High quality design and nice color options, the best part is that I saw these at a big box retailer for 36$ more than on Amazon!- and with just one color option, black and grey. I think these shoes are very attractive and comfortable, I actually bought a 2nd pair because i liked my first pair so much	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Pureboost-Running-Shoe/dp/B01MT1ML98?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01NALI0UG&psc=1

As someone with high arches and who overpronates, these have been fantastic. I really like this shoe. Comfortable all through the race. Great combo of stability and response. I am about 150 miles in and they still feel great. This saucony liberty fits me the best. It seems I fit into this group and thank God some one actually produces this shoe. Btw its fairly light weight and good for both training and race. Very lightweight and comfortable. It has provided better cushioning when I jog on a concrete surface. It isn't like running on a cushioned track, which I did for my cardio rehab, but it's definitely better than my previous shoes. Pricey but worth it IMO. More color selections would be nice but the neutral bluish gray works fine for me. Avid runner, Military for 12 years... used to more cushion for distance, this was more firm and tight around the feet, and can feel the bottoms when i run, not as good as I was hoping, but may just need to be broken in, great shoe, but not what i was expecting, Im picky A perfect match of light-weight, low heal to toe drop and stability to correct a minor pronation. I honestly haven't found a better combination of these factors in one running shoe. Fit is what I expected from Saucony. Excellent shoe, just the right amount of support. Im big; 250 pounds but these are breaking in nicely for running and walking. Great shoe. The difference in weight is only one ounce, so I'm happy. I would recommend these shoes to people who want a minimal drop, but have a narrow foot.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Liberty-ISO-Mens/dp/B07K6T254V?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B078RDHGDN&psc=1

58	28	Nike LunarGlide 9	['Suede', 'suede sole', '100% Authentic', 'Brand New', 'Durable', 'Original Packaging']	"Very comfortable, they have some support if you have flatter feet. Not motion control-level support but enough for them to be comfortable on shorter runs, at the gym, and around town. I got the Anthracite / Black / Cool Grey and they are good looking shoes. The 9.5 fits like glove. Best running shoe I have ever owned. The lunar glide 9 in 9.5 fits perfect AND has added feature of re-inforced heel box. Got these because they were on a list of shoes with the best arch support and I am SO happy with them. I actually ended up buying another pair in a different color haha. I have the flattest feet possible, so arch support is important--I also can't wear shoes that are too narrow. These have fantastic support and while they aren't narrow, they also aren't so wide as to look ""fat"". I get compliments on them because they are way stylish. They mesh-like fabric of the shoe's body is super breathable as well so my feet never get sweaty/stinky in these. Love em and definitely recommend!. I started using the Lunarglide 8 3 years ago, greats shoes, then the 9 came out and they were supreme for my running routine, very light and comfortable, they made a huge difference after using other expensive shoes, but looks like Nike is no longer making them and could not find at dicks sporting goods, neither at Nike online, I found them on other websites and ended up buying them at Amazon, look the same the same, but they don't feel the same, something is not right with this shoes, they don't feel as comfy as the other ones I had before, I need to look for different shoes now. I've bought these shoes several times, and this was a great price. They are very comfortable and provide the stability a slight over-pronator needs. I really liked the Lunarglide 6s and 7s - some of those wore out so I figured I'd give these a go.

Sadly, ASICS has gone through a significant redesign of the GT series, and the new design slips in the heel box for me. The short story is: I'm in love with them. I run about 125 miles a month and these shoes are perfect for my pace and mileage. The ride is comfortable--- more comfortable than my best experience with the GT-2000 and GT-2100 series over many years. They're also nicely styled (which is a nice to have for me, not a must have, but they do look good in the tomato orange!). This has renewed my love for ASICS shoes. I'm back on the road without worrying about my ride, and I'm a happy camper. PS --- the other comments about fit are true--- I went down a half-size from my usual fit, and these are just right. Unfortunately, they didn't have DynaFlytes but I needed a replacement shoe and figured I would once again try different brands and styles with the following criteria: light, comfortable but with good cushioning (because of the paranoia I have about my knees as I mentioned in the original review). I tried Brooks, Hoka, Saucony and, of course, ASICS. After much back and forth, I again chose ASICS, this time the Roadhawk FF. They felt lighter and less bulky than the Cumulus 19 and ultimately just a little more comfortable than the Saucony (my other finalist). Anyway, I decided to try another pair of DynaFlyte 2 at an even better price at Shoebacca (thru Amazon) and this time chose 11 instead of 10.5. Lo and behold, they are perfect. Light, comfortable, great cushioning and still a good-looking shoe. So, sorry to the ASICS folks for my previous review - my bad, I just bought the shoes a 1/2 too small - and thank you for continuing to make such great running shoes. Original review:
I've been wearing ASICS pretty much since I got serious about running. They're comfortable and light and the gel in the sole makes me feel hopeful that the daily pounding on asphalt may not be slowly wrecking my knees (so far, so good). I moved from the Contend 3 to Cumulus 18 (both bought in stores and compared with other styles and brands) and then Cumulus 19 before deciding to try the DynaFlyte 2 (both bought online). I'd read the reviews in Runner's World and online on the DynaFlyte and was excited to try something new with the cushioning I had grown to trust but in a lighter shoe. They are light and they're a nice looking shoe but they feel a little tight through the toe area when compared to the Cumulus. Read more Literally the best running shoes I've ran in, in a minute. I thought I had bought the best ones before I tried this model. Wow. So good that they'll have you bouncing around after a quick three mile run, like you just walked. The breathable mesh is awesome, because me feet sweat alot. These shoes keep my feet cool. I will definitely buy them again, when these wear out. They fit perfect right out the box and are a solid running shoe. Bottom line these shoes feel like you're running on pillows. They are awesome. Great shoes. These shoes are quite comfortable, good shock absorption, but for me I need a bit more support. On the plus side, they use the Speva lasting (the layer under the insole) and an Ortholite insole - this is the best combo for Asics shoes in my opinion. In recent times I have liked many ASICS shoes for fit, feel, etc, just not the bottom feel. Many of their shoes have Ortholite insole on top of Ortholite lasting layer. This Dynaflyte 2, and it sounds like the upcoming GT-2000 v6, are using Speva lasting and Ortholite insole. Many Nike shoes like Pegasus, Zoom Structure, Zoom Span, etc. use this combo and it is a great blend of shock absorption, cushion, but some responsiveness without mush. As per the listing and ASICS site, I ordered 10.5 instead of my usual 11, and they fit perfectly. If I weighed perhaps 30 lbs. less, likely these would have been fine, but I need a bit more stability."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-T7D0N-Dynaflyte-2/dp/B0787VQF5B?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073RRY719&psc=1

The recent versions have just become too narrow in the midfoot so I was hoping that the newest version would harken back to the glory days of the 17's where the shoe would fit virtually ANY foot shape, from heel to toe. The 17's were excellent at this. I have seen this across most lines of Asics, including the women's GT 2000 that my daughter wears and my wife's Kayanos. ASICS, please go break the Nimbus 17 era shoe plans out of the vault and start selling shoes to a wider variety of foot shapes again. Thank you.

The Noosa is--by far--the best shoe I've found for sockless running. Asics shoes are the best fit for me, and the Noosa gives enough support for my slight overpronation that the shoes always wear evenly. The ff has a much cleaner fit. However, the laces that come with the shoe are good laces and integrate with the shoe very nicely, and the overall performance of the ff makes up for these minor shortcomings. (I can live with losing some seconds in transition to lace my shoes.) Every runner seems to have their own favorite brand and model of shoe; for me, it's Asics, and the Noosa ff. I typically wear Gel Nimbus but got these because I stopped wearing socks for triathlons .. they are definitely lite and you can see where they cut out the fat for a race shoe and will work well for the run leg of Olympic distance triathlon... I put in 6 miles in the first day and I liked them for a race day shoe... I wouldn't recommend for beginner runners.. just shy of 5 stars because you can feel the fabric in the toe cap on your toe nails and I'd like to see a loop on the heel vs the tab to help with speed during race transition. I am sure I'll buy them again. This shoe would be great if they weren't both mis-sized and the toe box wasn't awful. I have never had a toe box fit me so tightly in the 20 pairs of Asics I've worn over the years. Plus, I always where a perfect 13 and the 13s I ordered were simply too small. Wake up and get your fit right!. I love the ASICS Noosa line and this is my 4th pair. Wasnt really in love with this design year but for the price I got them at I said why not. More importantly, the comfort is on par with the other Noosas Ive owned. I do feel like this may be a little smaller than previous ones but not too bad. Since then, Ive put on 20 Miles so far and theyre wearing nicely and I dont notice the toe-touching issue anymore. Overall great running sneakers and I will continue to stick with ASICS GEL Noosas. The web around the toes felt like hard plastic. Im on my feet running around a very large and busy emergency department, and I like shoes that keep me comfortable. Im a bit different in that I do not like lots of arch support. My foot has a good/average arch, and I like to allow for natural movement. The toe box is borderline tight, but is great because my feet are on the narrow size of M width. The interior of the shoe truly is soft and seamless to allow for bare feet if you choose. The outsole has great slip resistance. These shoes are on the smaller side of true to size, so I would size up by a half if you are on the border. Great great shoe. The redesign makes this a good looking shoe This is my first pair of the Noosa FF series. I love this FF style and the fit seems more snug(which I like-more support) than the Tri gel Noosa's. These shoes are great for comfort and style for me. I ordered a mens 11 because I usually wear a men's 11 in tennis shoes and these fit me perfectly. The color is very vibrant and I've got numerous compliments on them. ??	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Noosa-Running-Shoe/dp/B01GSRXNAW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01NCP7DUA&psc=1
66	6	Nike Flex Experience RN 7	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Hexagonal flex grooves in the outsole promote natural flexibility.', 'Heathered knit delivers lightweight comfort and breathability.', 'Rounded heel promotes a natural range of motion.', '', '']	"Good overall shoe - not quite as flexible as I was hoping. Otherwise comfortable, and it offers solid support. These came in extra wide width and I thought they would be perfect. They look great and the width is great. The issue is these sneakers have zero support or arch. So in addition to feeling like you are walking on uneven concrete, they are loud everywhere you go. To bad, I like the color, style (although they are not durable at all) and width. 4 months into using them heavily for sports (WITH orthotic insoles), they have held up pretty well and I havent had any notable slips. Be aware that I bought the WIDE version available in my usual shoe size, and they fit great. I see a lot of reviews stating they are too small/narrow/tight but maybe the wide would fit better. I dont normally look for wide fit shoes, but these fit very comfortably and have at least made me reconsideras I get olderthe importance of a comfortable, dependable shoe. I take off a point for poor comfort and support (I used custom insoles). It provides little to no support. My job has me on my feet all day, so good shoes are imperative. If you are looking for good support in a wide shoe and you are like most of us a few pounds over, find another shoe. I wanted a casual all black running shoes i could use to make quick trips to the grocery store or something casual to put on with joggers and this does the trick. I've always worn Nike Size 9 and that is what i got and the fit is perfect. The Insole cushioning would NOT give you the impression that you're walking on ""clouds"". As others have stated it might even be on the stiffer side in terms of cushioning comfort however, it is good enough for me. I walked around with it for a couple hours and my feets aren't sore. In my opinion, it is very light and comfortable. The sock like feel can give you the impression you're not wearing shoes when your feet are off the floor. If you want a casual shoe that is uncomplicated and looks simple, get this. I ordered a 12.5 just to be safe and it was way too small. I wont be purchasing the more expensive size as the $40 price tag was the best part about them (size 12.5 blue). I was planning on adding some inserts so thats fine. I just walked into work(Im a quality inspector) and walking across the concrete, it sounds like Ive got heels on, with the super cheap plastic soles clicking on the concrete. One may as well just buy Walmart shoes; its very similar in quality. This is a review of Amazon more than the product. Here's my warning: I thought I was buying a pair of Pegasus 35's, which are fantastic shoes--Amazon's page for Pegasus 35, however, shipped me this instead. So don't make the mistake I did and end up with a return and the long wait for money to go back into your pocket."	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Mens-Flex-Experience-Shoe/dp/B0716SFCDC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07KWXGNSF&psc=1
67	7	Asics Gel Excite 4	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately Low-Top"" from arch', 'Rearfoot GEL Cushioning System: Attenuates shock during impact phase and allows for a smooth transition to midstance.', 'Removable Sockliner: A sockliner which can be removed to accommodate a medical orthotic.', 'AHAR Outsole: Acronym for ASICS High Abrasion Rubber. Placed in critical areas of the outsole for exceptional durability.', 'Reflectivity']"	"So, instead I tried to set him up for success by buying him his first pair of real running shoes. It was like he had access to a whole new world. We're both so excited for this new chapter in our lives, where we can embark on this new active running and marathoning journey TOGETHER! It's all thanks to ASICS!

We've since come back and bought him another pair for everyday use. I don't think he'll ever wear anything else, haha!. I returned them and ordered the next half size and it seems more like what I expected. I usually wait to review until I get a better idea what the product performs like over time, but I thought others needed to know about the sizing issue. I bought a pair of Gel Excite 2 back in early 2015 and its served me pretty well for all the 5- and 10ks Ive worn them for over the past 2 yearsand just walking in general. I liked the Excite 2 so you can bet that for 4, I was just as excited (pun always intended). I really like the design and feel of it. Its incredibly light to the point where I sometimes feel like Im not wearing any shoes. Now, it is comfortable, but going back to the fact that I have wide feet, its a tad tight. Ive had these shoes for almost one month and have easily put 50k+ on them so Id like to believe theyve been broken into. As others have mentioned, the size for Excite 4 is smaller than what you may expect so you would most likely have to go half a size up. For me, I was a 9.5W for Excite 2 and went with 10W for Excite 4. Length-wise its fine since I went up but it still would be better if it were a tad wider. I still recommend these shoes though. This is my 4th pair of Asics running shoes and absolutely love them. They are light and comfortable. So comfortable it's almost like walking and running on sponges. I fell in love with the Asics brand. The size that fit me best was the 10.5 with the Asics. Once those wore out I knew my size and have purchased every pair since on Amazon. What I do if they are slightly tight is just loosen the laces and widen the opening down the top of the shoe consistently (see my photo). This works very well and I am so happy. However once you know your size in these particular shoes (or any brand for that matter) you are set to order through Amazon. If you have a wider fit make sure to order a wide size, the medium will certainly be too narrow. Another thing I really enjoy about these shoes are besides being so lightweight the mesh breaths very well. You can actually feel the airflow through them on a cool day. This helps air out your feet and prevents any odor inside the shoes. If you've never tried a pair of ASICS I highly recommend them. A nice looking low-rise running shoe, but I found it unusually narrow/tight. I already order up a half-size for ASICS (10.5 instead of 10) which typically works fine, but in this Gel-Excite 4, the toe area and across the top of the foot was still very tight. Skip the Excite unless you have narrow feet or are willing to experiment on widths. These are awesome shoes. I wanted something afforadable with favorable reviews. Having spent $50 on these shoes, it now seems as though it was the bargain of the year. First impression out of the box. The look good, I wore for the whole day and they felt pretty good. I work 2 shifts and these are really amazing shoes. I work at an Amazon fulfillment facility so I walk a lot. So I burn through shoes and they need to fit well and be comfortable. Which is pretty good based on my overuse. I recommend these a lot."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Excite-Running-Shoe/dp/B017S1KLD4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FY8HXNE&psc=1
68	8	Nike Free 5.0	['mesh', 'LIFESTYLE Shoes', 'NIKE FREE 5.0 PRINT']	Very good I give this 2 stars because after less than one week of wearing, a hole ripped in the fabric on the side. Amazon was great with the return and I did order a new pair because my daughter loves the print - we shall see if it was just a defect in the ones we received.	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Unisex-Free-5-0-Sneakers/dp/B00QSPVWGC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B014IPOB8E&psc=1
69	9	Adidas AlphaBounce Beyond	['Textile and Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Lace closure with zoned forged mesh upper and textile lining']	"I have had the Alphabounce Beyond for just over a month or so now and felt that myself enough time to write on honest review. I will start off with the pros and cons for folks who want a summary and then write a detailed review/observation log below. Pros:
- Serious bang for the buck (among the best compared to shoes in the same category/price point)
- Materials feel premium for such a price point, something Adidas has been generous with for many recent models
- Versatile use whether it be for daily tasks/work or exercising
- Strong variety in color options as well as an appealing look that seems to feel appropriate for many occasions
- Comfortably wide, will accommodate many foot shapes, fits true to size
-Easy to clean with a cloth towel and water (light soap if needed)

Neutral:
-Neither on the light or heavy side when compared to competitors
-Tad wider outsole than previous gen shoe that some may find too wide in appearance

Cons:
-Some may find the laces a tad long if they are used to only tieing single knot laces

Considering the price point of this shoe you are getting an excellent deal due to the shoe's ability to be worn in several manners. Runners and those who workout regularly will feel satisfaction in the bounce technology as the sole material seems to offer excellent energy return and stability without feeling overly hard or uncomfortable. This same technology is also great for those who merely want to go on walks and accomplish daily tasks such as grocery shopping or going to a job/career where standing and moving about is typical. The various meshes and layers that make up the shoe provide an excellent sense of lockdown and stability while also providing interesting textures that give the shoe a distinct look and feel. In my book, the most notable material has to be the lining of the inside and well as on the heel tab due to the fact it provides a silky sensation upon entry or exit. The liner also feels great while the shoes are on feet and do not overheat or feel slippery. I also own the previous generation Alphabounce and felt great satisfaction in that purchase as well. This newer model happens to improve a few things here and there, most notably a slightly broader base that feels more supportive, a stronger and more premium looking heel cage, subjectively a better-looking shoe as a whole. As a whole anyone purchasing these shoes should feel they have made a great purchase, my older pair has lasted well over a year with just some wear in the bottom sole; a quick tip, occasional cleaning with an old brush and some water restore the look of these things. Hope you found my review to be helpful, it was a pleasure writing about a product that has excited me so much over this period of time. I will post a couple pictures for reference (note I wear a size 11 and am 6'2"" perhaps that will give you some sense of scale while on feet)
Read more They are comfortable and fit as expected. However, I think for me they are good for slow jogs over a long distance. Good value for a quality shoe. Appearance wise these are right on the money. The three stripes on the tounge is cool. Reflective heel and strap is a nice touch. The mid sole/heel are pretty massive but the stance is on point. Great shoe. The shoes feel great. Shopping online these shoes looked beautiful. In person they look even better. However the pair that I received not only had damaged parts but they had clearly been worn before. The shoes do feel premium and I am not worried about quality as they feel durable. I would highly recommend purchasing these shoes but from a different website as the ones I received were probably returned by another customer and the seller didn't have the decency to at least wash the shoes. Unique teal color has generated numerous compliments. Good, solid shoe for colder weather as well. Most comfortable shoe I own. I have Jordan's, Air Max and Ultra Boost. These are comfortable ? They have now become my fav shoes...true to size, not too tight around the front...great all around"	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Alphabounce-Beyond-Running-Shoe/dp/B071S6CTCK?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0711QXW6N&psc=1
70	10	Hoka One One Cavu	['fabric', 'Imported', 'Fashion Trend: Ankle-High Mesh Running Shoe']	"The only shoe that makes my feet happy. Hoka One are all amazing. Great heal cushion. I have ran over 10 times in them at a distance of 3 to 6 Miles each time and Im pleased with the comfort. Perfect for an underpronator. Sole is robust. Very comfortable for long runs. Love these shoes!. I work in the OR and they have been the best money I have spent. I have tried numerous different brands... these by far have been the best!. Fits true to size pretty small for a size 12 comparing them to other brands. i would suggest going up 1/2 to 1 full size on these, or even more if you will be using them for long distance hiking. forefoot is also very narrow, giving them an odd feel. I dont know whos foot these were designed for, but it sure wasnt mine.
after going from a zero drop shoe, these things feel like im wearing high heels. would not recommend. I love the comfort of the shoe and how it helps soften the impact for my bad knee. A shoe with some awesome cushioning. I can say that they are very nice casual everyday shoes"	https://www.amazon.com/HOKA-ONE-Mens-Cavu-Running/dp/B0719LDNPW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0721D9MGS&psc=1

72	12	Hoka One One Bondi 5	['mesh', 'Full EVA Midsole Provides Signature HOKA ONE ONE Cushioning', 'Moderate Heel Bevel Provides Smooth Heel Transition', '3D Puff Print Frame for Lightweight, Detailed Support', 'Zonal Rubber Placement for Durability']	"The first pair I re-glued because I thought it was a fluke since I have had such good luck with HOKA and I like the way they feel and ride during my run.
. HOKA if you're reading this hopefully quality control/manufacturing will be stepped up to get the soles on the Bondi 5 to stay together. The increase by 1/2 size resulted in getting shoes which are really comfortable as well as pretty cool looking. I just ordered some Thorlos thick padded socks with extra padding in the ball of the foot area just to play it safe. I LOVE these shoes. They are comfortable and relieve a lot of stress on my joints. For such a young brand they really should have better warranties. Again, great shoes but their durability is garbage. I hope it gets better. I loved the 4 even though it had a few problems, but the 5 fixed all of them. The heel is vastly improved, the laces are better, and the outsole has more durability zones, than the previous bondi. What really gets me though, is how generous the cushioning is. For pretty much the same money as the top shelf in other running brands, they give you almost twice as much cushion underfoot (most companies list the exact mm of cushion in the heel and forefoot). I thought having so much cushion would make my stride awkward, but they use all that material to somehow shape the perfect stride. I'm always looking for great cushioning and stability. The Bondi 5-I knew as soon as I put it on that it was going to be great. I wear a standard width but love a larger toe box. This shoe is perfect for that. Great cushioning, stability and fit. I feel like i should buy 5 more in case they make changes. So far so good. After my 3rd run in them I can say, without reservation, theses are the most comfortable, supportive and best quality running shoes Ive put my Fred Flinstone feet into. The construction is superior and the uppers are breathable without feeling flimsy. The toe box hugs without squeezing eliminating bothersome pressure points Ive experienced with other brands. Looks aside, it feels like Im running on a cloud. UPDATE: After several more runs I am convinced these are the best running shoes Ive ever run in"	https://www.amazon.com/Hoka-Mens-Bondi-Running-Shoe/dp/B072Q13DQL?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BRSK3WN&psc=1
73	13	Salomon Sense Ride	['Mesh', 'Made in USA or Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Premium Wet Traction Contagrip outsole and profeel film chassis', 'Compressed EVA and EnergyCell', 'Opal and Vibe midsole', 'Molded EVA, OrthoLite sockliner, 3D stretch air mesh upper and friction free lace eyelet', 'Quicklace, Sensifit, lace pocket and EndoFit']	The point of the Sense range is to be very low drop shoes so you have great ground feel and, if you're a forefoot runner in particular, so you're not carrying around an excess of baggage (and weight) on the rear end of the shoe. Those who land on the rear of their feet are happy to have shoes such as the Speedcross because they want a ton of rear impact protection for their heels and joints. The former issue, however, it seems like Salomon was attempting to address with the Sense Ride, which in the end feels and rides like a somewhat clumsier re-do of the old Crossmax, which, much as I loved it, was really just a Salomon take on a Pegasus or similar everyman shoes with trail running colors, cool speedlaces, and a touch of trail lug. The traction's fine, but it's not something I've found I can count on in wet or if the trail is something other than a park path or grass. I had really high hopes for the Rides, but other than the fun paint job, they're not a serious trail shoe for me. Read more This shoe has all of the attributes I love about Salomon trail shoes - I've always found the heel and midfoot well locked down, excellent grip in the outsole and the integrated tongue and quicklace system are things I'd really like to see more widely adopted in the industry. I would turn my ankle occasionally, not terribly and years of trail running has prepared me somewhat for this, but then one day I turned an ankle a little and elected to continue for a few more miles to reach the trailhead. Once finding proper sizing the shoe has good comfort, support. Very comfortable out of the box. I have been surprised by this shoe repeatedly, nearly every time run in it I find something else to like about it. For starters, the fit is fantastic. I feel like it wraps around the contours of my foot, holding it precisely in place for each step. Overall, my experience in this shoe has been excellent. I will run my first trail race in them tomorrow, and I look forward to the comfort and stability they will provide for the 25k we plan to traverse together. I had these shoes since July of 2017 and I am mostly satisfied with them. The comfort also results from the combination of the tech that went into this new design. Salomon lists Compressed EVA, Energy Cell, VIBE, and OPAL as part of what forms the midsole, which means that the shoes provide the most cushioning, energy return, and better load distribution to reduce pressure on your feet. The right toe has a nice little hole even though I don't use them beyond a 1-2 mile daily walk around the city. I think they are very comfortable overall, but not durable enough to last more than a year at the most.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MQMRDN7/ref=asc_df_B01MQMRDN71555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01MQMRDN7&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Obviously this makes them not ideal for winter but great for jogging or exercising. I was expecting a very comfortable shoe but it's only average. Average would be ok except for the fact this is a $70-$80 shoe that should outperform shoes that cost only $30. I had tried on several before settling on these because someone suggested Nike is the best. It's a good shoe, comfortable and accurate to size. If you buy a cheap shoe, get a gel insert and you'll likely enjoy those more than these. Hope this helps. My all-time favorite shoe ever. Light and comfortable, even with mely extra wide, flat feet. Great comfortable shoes. Size was perfect. Feet don't hurt when I walk/jog. These are the most comfortable Nikes I have ever owned. They are particularly good for people with slightly wider than average feet. These shoes are great. I gave these a try and I couldnt be happier with my purchase. These sneakers are very comfortable and feel like you are walking on a cloud. I would recommend to anyone. Comfort right out of the package. Super fast shipping. dope, these shoes are nice af, comfortable, look good, arrived on time, what else I've just started running and was getting blisters with my old shoes.

Will definitely buy again and absolutely recommend. I have been a loyal Asics buyer for over 30 years and honestly these are about the most comfortable of all the Asics I have ever purchased. Feels like I'm wearing a pair of socks over another pair of socks with comfort and support. Highly recommended. These are comfortable shoes.

76	16	Adidas Ultra Boost Uncaged	['Textile', 'Synthetic sole', 'sku=da9160-11.5']	"One time I was taking out the garbage during the rain and my father-in-law's Adidas were closest to the door, and I figured, ""I've been paying for these shoes, let's see the hype."" It took my 8.4 seconds to walk down the stairs with the trash bag, put it into the garbage can, drag the can to the street and come back indoors, I didn't get a single drop of rain water on me because I ran as fast as Usain Bolt and it was like walking on a puff of air, so these are certainly worth the money! i love these shoes. they are knit, so they will stretch over time, but they are my perfect shoe. usually i size at 11. i am a bit narrow, but 11 normally does the trick. The toe box in these felt a little wide when i tried them on in store, so i went with 10.5 and they were perfect. I would NOT use these for things that require agility movements or something like tennis.. they just wont hold up. Running or getting around every day, they are perfect. The most comfortable shoe I've worn yet. These are very comfortable and I even recommend them for the other masochists out their. They seem to be pretty responsive, with the right balance of cushioning and feel for the road. I'm a 180 lbs with good mechanics. Good- light weight, easy on/off, nice energy return and cushioned sole. Provides nice ride on track and up to 10mile long run. The knit upper absorbs water and sweat and shoe ends up soaking through very easily if running through grass in morning dew, from light rain or sweat during a hot summer workout. Still, quite comfortable. The boost advantage is crazy. Great shoe. Very comfortable and it honestly does feel like Im using less muscle when walking or running. Another great shoes from adidas. It fits perfectly and it feels like your not actualy wearing a shoe because its so light and very comfotable. I had the regular Ultraboosts with the cage and was apprehensive to get these, but they feel great and I don't miss the extra structure of the cage. Highly recommend. Super comfortable and the color is pretty cool too. I always get compliments on them when I wear them."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-BY2555-Mens-Ultraboost-Uncaged/dp/B07944DDL4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07C6VF1KN&psc=1
77	17	Adidas Adizero Adios Boost 3.0	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Imported', 'adidas running shoes']	"Not only this is one of the most comfortable and enjoyable running shoes Ive ever used - on par with my current favorites, the Saucony Kinvara 8 - but they look really good. Usually I dont care about how my running shoes look, but I must admit these ones caught me by the eyes. But the final decision was made by my feet, who really enjoyed them. Ill probably stay with Sauconys for my full marathons, but who knows, Id say these are capable of going all the way as well. I like this shoe a lot. It's super light and good to wear for exercising and hot days. They are very good quality and weigh almost nothing. I have no idea, but I have on hand a half-dozen pairs of Adizero Adios (mostly the Boost 2 or Boost 3), all in the same size as these, and these ones are simply larger. I'd give one star, since sizing consistency for a shoe brand has to be a top priority, but these are some fine lookin' kicks, so there's that. Most comfortable running shoes ever. Ran 10mi day I received, awesome. Open knit upper keeps your feet cool. Best part about them IMHO is perfect balance between Adidas boost tech and minimalism, resulting in ultra comfortable super lightweight construction. Adidas shoes tend to run small and narrow, I always get a 1/2 size larger and fit is always perfect. I'd recommend the same for everyone. Lastly these shoes are just down right sexy looking ? These do fit smaller than other Adidas, see my photos. I'm sure they will be great but I ordered size 8.5 which is the same as my other Adidas and they're too small and tight. Great shoes. Lost 30 pounds and realized I didn't need all the Boost of the Supernovas so I went with more of a running flat... the Adios 3. I saw these shoes and thought ""those are ugl... wait those are sexy!""

Love em, perfect fit. They fit great at that size. The shoes are super lightweight. I prefer a more substantial lace. Not a big deal and they are a great shoe. These are very comfortable shoes. I've took them on a run and I like how springy they feel, but without too much cushioning"	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Adizero-Adios-Aktiv-Running/dp/B071LGHZ87?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B072BWQK53&psc=1
78	18	Saucony Ride 10	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'EVERUN top sole', 'Woven heel support', 'Engineered Mesh', 'Powerfoam midsole']	"I love these shoes. I crossed the 200 mile mark and am relatively pleased. I am a big fan of Saucony and this is my third pair of Rides. The shoes offer plenty of cushion (almost too much for my taste) and the right amount of support (pretty neutral). I wore a small hole in the back heel at around 150 miles (I would normally hope for at least 300 miles before seeing this type of damage). Overall, this a good shoe. I am excited to try the ISO version. I hope it trims a bit of weight off the shoes. Saucony has a great product and the technical info and shoe guide on their Web site is very good. Be sure to understand what a stability shoe is and what it may or may not do for you. Not all instore sales persons are knowledgeable enough to provide good help and guidance. There's a lot to like about this shoe, comfortable excellent cushion, lightweight and breathable. The laces slide effortlessly through the eyelets which allows perfect lace tension. Since I've been wearing this shoe, I'm able to run more frequently without shin pain. This shoe fits perfectly a half-size up from my true size. The Saucony Ride 10 may be the best I've worn. This shoe fits great, isn't heavy and clunky like many, and provides great cushioning. After wearing them on several runs and being satisfied with fit and function, I bought two new pair. As expected, the shoes met all expectations while putting in double digit miles each day for a week at Disney and also performed flawlessly on my runs (usually about six miles). Great shoes. I love the shoes ... the feel, the weight and fit ... this is the first time this has ever happened. Im too late for a refund/replacement and hoping that someone from the company will see this and send me a right shoe, size 10 I live in Europe to be precise Ireland so any one ordering a pair will see the size (us size) 11M OR 11W the ""M"" is the same width as the European standard ""D"" width for men.The ""W"" is the same as ""E"" width. I ran a tempo run and did H.I.I.T. straight out of the box with these runners,that is how much faith i have in this brand and model.Everyone has different shaped feet and to make mine worse i have to wear custom made orthotics so it took a lot of trying other brands to find the perfect glove like fit. I have tried the ""ISO"" fit range and they do not hug my foot like these.I would recommend that if you are not aware of the ""heel lock"" or sometimes called the""lace lock"" to look up videos on YouTube on how to do it with the extra lace hole that is provided on most running shoes as my heal is raised with the orthotics and the lace lock glues the runner to my foot.I have tried using it on the ISO fit range Triumph ISO2 to be exact and it is to tight which caused a hot spot but that shoe is a total different ball game to this one,the Triumph has 30mm(27mm Ride) cushioning at the rear and it is so comfy to run in but weights in more then the Ride and you will feel the weight difference when running(its around 50grammes for each shoe.)I have been currently running in Hoka Bondai-6 with their massive 37mm rear cushioning and 33mm mid-foot and fore foot and it is a delight on hard surfaces,if you are not trying to run a fast pace or are recovering from an injury and they are also stable with my orthotics but do not breath as good as these Sauconys,i found them very airy on the run not sweaty as it was a warm day. I think i am going to make my Hokas redundant for running now and just use them for walking as the cushioning in these Sauconys is...not as soft as the Hoka but soft enough to give you a great responsive kick-back from the energy you put in.I felt great during my first run,the foot hugging slipper feel with just enough cushioning and airflow through the shoe and a major responsive kick-back of energy has made me decide that on my next training run which is that long slow hour run i will be wearing these instead of my Hoka Bondai-6. As for the color i dislike it i find it retro-boring which seems to be the fashion at the moment i would have loved the red-blue model but alas,i could not find a pair.The good side of not liking the look of your runners is you will not think twice about running in the muck or rain and getting them dirty,you will have the chance to give them a custom dirt look to cover up what you do not like.Overall i do not count style over performance,these are an amazing shoe and i hope they keep making them as they fit my golem feet like a glove and respond like they are aiding my performance"	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Ride-10-Running-Shoes/dp/B072QGRGMD?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MZ743DV&psc=1

Read more I love Asics. For the money, I'd love to see a shoe that was a little more durable. These shoes are NOT durable, but they fit perfectly. The GT-2000 6 are a very comfortable shoe, however the toe mesh began ripping apart after using them approximately 5-7 times during just normal walking around to break them in before I began using them for running. I have had many pairs of GT-2000 and previous models over the years and never had a problem. THANKS! I shouldve listened to the warnings from others on Amazon. I would switch to another brand, but this model seems to provide the best comfort for some overpronation and othe foot issues. So, I guess Im stuck with Continuing to buy the GT 2000 5 every six months, because the heel rips out. I would gladly pay more For a version of the series that actually had some durability. Perfect fit for my flat feet, very confortable support and cushioned as necessary, strongly recommended for overpronator feet... Very comfortable shoes but bad upper materials Fantastic running shoes. Great upgrade from the prior Asics Nimbus 14 I previously had. Really enjoy the new innovations they have created with the flytefoam technology. The shoes are very light but provides adequate cushion which is imperative on the long distance runs of several miles. Also the shoe still maintains its guideline.Love the color as well of the shoe which enables visibility from far away distances. The GT 2000 is my first shoe in the GT series and so far has lived up to expectations. Other relevant asics shoes are the nimbus, Kayano as well."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-GT-2000-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B071NZZS8D?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07F3FG3M3&psc=1
80	20	New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 v8	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Fresh Foam', 'Bootie Construction', 'No-sew material application', '', '']	"After a few months I noticed that the very thin shoestrings literally started to cut through the very top hole. I stand by the initial review below, but hard plastic eyelets for the top two would be great. Otherwise - all good. They were absolutely wonderful and lasted for about a year of fairly active walking. I also wore them pretty much everywhere, not just for exercise walking.

Its well known in the running world that good shoes might last about 3 months doing their job as designed. Walking of course isnt as tough on shoes as serious running, so my year of good cushion and support was about right. I recently upgraded to the 1080v8 and it seems to be even better. Great shoes. I was a bit hesitant to order the v7s online initially, but I ordered the exact same size I had in my earlier pair of 990s and the v7s - and these v8s - fit fine. Top then off with a pair of Superfeet Copper insoles also here in Amazon and youll be set. Scrubbing with a popular carpet cleaner will be required. Read more These shoes are amazing. I have struggled with planters fasciitis for years and finally have a shoe that has seemed to help so far. Ive ran 15+miles and my feet feel great. Overall, excellent shoe. This shoe fits comfortably throughout my longer runs (10-15miles). It is pretty light weight but has substantial cushioning without being bulky. I wear a size 10 but always by half size if for running shoes & would recommend that for these as well. I came close to loving this shoe. I've run in various versions of the 1260 line, and particularly liked 1260v3 and 1260v5. 1260v4 was just OK for me, given the wider shoe. Hope that will give someone a feel for this shoe!. I went to a local shoe store and tried on the 1080v8, before ordering an 11-D from Amazon Wardrobe. I was pretty certain that I'd like it. Wish that they'd have described the shoe as ""neutral"" in the Amazon description, as this shoe doesn't provide the modest ""stability"" that I need. But I love the fit. I have a narrow foot with a high arch, and the D width perfectly hugs my foot. I almost always have to settle for 9E. These 9Ws, though, are perfect, fit right out of the box. Extremely light as well. I would like to state what I will be doing in these shoes and my review is on these things alone. First thing i noticed is I really like the style of these shoes, when trying them on the tongue is plush and the support around the back part of the ankle is very nice. The quality seems very good. I recommend these to anyone who needs a pair of sneakers that you can do a variety of things in while being comfortable and stylish. I bought these to be my winter runners and am very happy with them from a construction, appearance and performance standpoint. If you normally wear a 10-1/2 in Nike shoes these will fit you perfectly. They're super comfortable and look great. Am a big Asics fan and these are the first New Balance shoes I have owned. Very impressed with the fit and feel of these shoes. Also the fresh foam is a great ride. I use these to wear to the gym on upper body workout days and for casual wear when lots of walking is involved."	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-1080v8-Fresh-Running/dp/B000GTQJ1E?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B06XDH4MWX&psc=1
81	21	Adidas Ultraboost Clima	['Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'adidas', 'Imported']	"I really like the comfort and looks of these shoes but after 6 months both shoes have their soles split open on the bottom. The top of the shoe still looks new. I never saw any of my Nike Frees ever do this after years. I never really paid attention to the importance of a good pair of running shoes until I started experiencing Achilles pain. My first pair of Ultra Boost were 4.0's, which I immediately loved and put 400 miles on before I retired them. Subsequently I bought a pair of Ultra Boost Parleys, which at first I wasn't sold on (they felt a bit tight and not as comfortable) but as I broke them in and racked up the miles I really grew to love them. This most current pair, the Climas, are my favorite of the three. PRO's
1) They fit like a glove, although please note that as with all 3 pairs I've owned run a bit small, so size up half a size for the best fit
2) They have a neutral feel, which I love. If you are an over pronator, it may be wise to look for a stability type of shoe.
3) They breathe sooooo good. I live in a super hot climate, so the extra large perforation is welcomed. If you live in cold or wet areas, again, this shoe may not be for you.
4) My legs feel great and my Achilles pain is minimal, even after a 10+ mile Road run. I have used them both on and off the road, and I feel that the road is where they are best suited. That patented ""boost"" cushy feeling that I love with the adidas is just as great on mile 9 as it is mile 1. The bottom line is I don't think any of the Ultra Boost's get the proper credit for being great running shoes. This is my favorite pair I've owned, and the fact that they inspired me to write a review (I rarely write reviews, I'm kind of lazy) speaks volumes. Read more Potentially the most comfortable sneakers / shoes I've ever worn. So much so - I'm thinking of buying another pair just like them. People think they look cool - and they're breathable. I love sneakers from TOD's to LeBron's ... and these are the most comfortable - by far. Congrats ADIDAS - you did it. Got these and a pair of pureboost in 9 and they both fit perfectly. On to comfort. Ultraboost is more cushioned and comfortable than pureboost. They are both comfortable and stylish. Love the comfort while out waking with my family. Turns out they're the real deal and fit just right. My son was very happy. Nice looking shoe and comfortable. Keeping them just have to wear really thin socks and hopefully that material will stretch a bit safer wearing. This shoe is amazing. This is my second pair of Ultra Boost, first pair of Clima. I would recommend them to anyone. Hope this helps. don't let the photos fool you, they are bright red. The boost sole is soft, however thin. Racers might like the feel of the road, but I wanted more protection for my joints."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Mens-Ultraboost-Clima/dp/B077XK7P49?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077XJ15PX&psc=1

I ordered my normal size (9) and it fits perfectly. I like that the shoe laces are not 5 miles long. Im not a big runner, but i walk alot on varied terrain and also hike in the woods alot and i feel these shoes cover all areas well. The extra cushioning puts plantar fascitis at ease. Really great shoe for hiking. Best trail runner on the market in my opinion.

A Podiatrist told me I needed a good stability tennis shoe and to do stretches multiple times a day. As soon as I put it on, it felt like a slice of heaven. So I went home and ordered through Amazon. I am wearing them with the premium orthotics from the Walking Company, so I cant speak to what the footbed feels like without them. But in general, the comfort is amazing. The padding around the ankle is supreme and feels like it holds my foot in a secure position. The shoe keeps my foot from pronating, the lace up area is snug and secure, the toe box is roomy for my toes. The sole is perfect for me...its very stable but doesnt feel like a cast like some of the higher stability New Balances did. The Brooks Adrenaline 18 took just a day or so to break in and get used to, and after 1 week I had good improvement, after 2 weeks it is like night and day from when I started wearing them. Im feeling mostly better!!. Theyre so amazing, I bought a second pair from another company on a Black Friday sale in a different color. If you use orthotics, Id recommend a half size up. The wide is not too wide at all, its perfect!. I now see the importance of buying better quality shoes, I will never go back. Love, love, love these shoes!!. Dont hesitate to get these gems, your feet will love you for it!!. Nothing has helped and being I work in healthcare and am on my feet a solid 8 plus working hours not to mention before and after work I needed something that will allow me to work and doesnt effect my walking as my other shoes have in the past. After spending an hour and a half being fitted and walking around the store in multiple brands of shoes I chose Asics bc they are a shoe that is known to help people who are on their feet like I am. I came home and looked on Amazon for the exact Brooks shoe to purchase at a cheaper price to give them a try. I came across other types of Brooks and liked the Brooks Launch color scheme better. I am not a multi color shoe person the less color the better. The Launches were the greatest shoe purchase I have EVER made. My feet do NOT hurt at all and if so it is minimal and I am able to walk without hobbling. I plan to purchase another couple pairs bc they are that comfortable. Anyone who is searching for a comfortable shoe should definitely consider these shoes. I hope they work for others as well as they do for me. So glad I found these!. I love this brand and this particular style. So I switched to Brooks (I had a pair back in the day I liked a lot and knew the toe box was constructed differently). Still love Aasics for comfort overall, but Brooks is my work shoe. As a nurse, I tried all those ugly clog things but quickly returned to Brooks.
**EDIT** Noticed many helpful votes so I thought I would update/expound on my original review. I have worn this pair of shoes to work for 8 months now and they feel just as good as when I got them. I read a ton of reviews and these Brooks had the best ratings. I decided to try them and although it's only been just over a week, I love them. They are so light and comfortable and make running seem easier than usual. I run about 3-4 times a week, totally 20 miles - I just want to provide an idea of how the shoe is used. I've always had issues with shoes not providing enough support but these seem perfect. Otherwise - I love these!"	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075TGCNJ2/ref=asc_df_B075TGCNJ21555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B075TGCNJ2&linkCode=asn&psc=1
84	24	New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 v9	['Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Fresh Foam midsole cushioning technology for superior comfort and support', 'Ortholite Sockliner', 'Engineered Mesh', 'Bootie Construction']	I'll just say I've worn Neutral shoes before,and these are very stable on your feet. Woo boy, I don't think I've quite felt a shoe that is both extremely cushioned and supportive at the same time. A lot of shoes claim to be this, but this is just... special. I can't feel the ground underneath my feet as a walk, there's a ton of spring to this shoe, but it feels solid. The fit is really nice too, I have wide feet and after the first day the mesh upper has stretched to feel very comfortable. And these shoes hold up very nicely, the cushioning seems to be holding up well. Overall I'm completely satisfied. I thought it couldn't get much better than Ultraboosts, but I can genuinely say I enjoy wearing these more. Oh, did I mention how freaking awesome they look. I have been buying New Balance shoes for many years and these 1080v9 shoes are the softest and most comfortable shoes ever. I like the black color because it does not show dirt as the shoe gets older. Great shoe, Ive been wearing the 1080 for some time, they keep improving, the shoe is a little lighter on top with more cushion and the heal of the shoe is much easier to get on and off and very comfortable, it feels a little more wrap around the ankle, have the grey and the black/white, looking forward to more colors coming out At 210 lbs, and 72 yrs old, its hard on my back and knees when I jog. These are the most comfortable shoe that I have ever had. Is has a great amount of cushion and weighs next to nothing, so I find it a very comfortable walking shoe for both the treadmill and on pavement. The heel fit is a little odd, took a week to get used to it. It's not uncomfortable, it just feels odd, like your heel is not fully inside the shoe somehow. On the other hand the shoe fits smaller than expected, I wear NB leather shoes as my day to day shoe, currently wear the 623 model, and the 10.5 EE fits just right every time. The 1080v9 on the other hand I had to go all the way to 11.5 EE to get a good fit. This is my first NB 1080 model, and it complies perfectly with what i was searching (good cushioning and stability, in a good balance with the weight). Bought these for my son who has been very pleased with them	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-1080v9-Fresh-Running/dp/B07B422CC2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MFM25ZZ&psc=1
85	25	Mizuno Wave Inspire 14	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Cloudwave offers a soft stable and lively lightweight feel', 'Airmesh upper', 'Fit in motion upper for flexible support', '', '']	"I liked the way the Inspire 13 fit and the support it provided on my runs. I ordered this running shoe ( the Wave Inspire 14) because I was not able to find the version 13s. I took these Inspire 14s for one run so far (6 miles) and was happy with the support, room in the toe box and the overall fit. Mizuno has done it again, my favorite running shoe got just a little bit better this year. The redesigned upper material was more breathable and I noticed a marked decrease in the amount of sweat build up in my socks compared to the Wave Inspire 13's. I ordered these shoes because the design looked similar to an Asics model I wore and my favorite pair of old Saucony running shoes. The price was comparable, there were positive reviews, and the specs looked ideal for a runner with feet a little wide for Nike, but still comfortable in most shoes, with a normal arch and an even midfoot strike. The Mizuno Waves were heavier than expected, had excessive plastic support on the base of the shoe from the heel to the midfoot, and a chunky rigid running platform altogether. The laces were very large caliber (not a fan, I recommend switching out for Lock Laces), but after several readjustments I discovered the laces weren't causing the issue--it was the stiff ""Runbird"" logo on the exterior of the shoe which had less give than the rest of the fabric, thus restraining that portion of my midfoot and causing pain/inversion. I have had every model of the same model shoe starting at the Wave Inspire 8, they all have fit as they should and they wear average. I run 12-18 miles a week and use them on an elliptical or bike as well as General weight lifting 5-6 days a week and can usually get 6-8 months out of them. These are some of the best feeling pairs of shoes I have had. I have very flat feet from the military, and the arch support and heel cushion is great. I felt like I was running on clouds. I usually get wide shoes for companies like Under Armour and Nike, but the shoes fit me perfect with the regular width. The Mizuno Wave Inspire are a helluva shoe. I am primarily a walker; I walk anywhere from 3-5 miles a day up pretty good inclines mixing in wind sprints twice a week and I love the way my feet respond to these shoes. The heel to toe transition is very nice and the cushioning is great. As a stability shoe, I can tell they help pronation especially on longer walks. From top to bottom the first thing you notice is how well they are made. This in my opinion is what separates Mizuno from many other top rated running shoes. This is one of the things I look for because Im pretty cheap but pay up for these shoes because they last. They are very comfortable and do a good job keeping your feet cool as well. Not to mention they are pretty sharp looking. The best thing about these shoes is the probably the most underrated as well...the outsole. Mizunos outsole is the best in the industry in my opinion at standing up to wear. Ive tried top of the line Adidas, ASICS, and Nikes but Mizunos outsoles outlast them ten fold. Although this makes them slightly heavier, its totally worth it for someone that walks on rough pavement like me. I have a pair of $200 adidas ultra boosts which are supposedly made for road running but the outsole started wearing down to the foam after only a month. My last pair of wave inspires lasted over a year. Read more I purchased these shoes for my son and he has been very pleased with them. It was a very good purchase and he is very happy with the shoe. Finally mizuno made this model shoe perfect all around. I knew these shoes where close to perfection and this specific model is amazing. Glad they got a new designer as well, they dont look as dumb.."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071NLG9T7/ref=asc_df_B071NLG9T75865861?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B071NLG9T7&linkCode=asn&psc=1
86	26	Adidas AlphaBounce	['100% Engineered mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Removable insole']	"Putting these sneakers on is like sliding your foot into heaven. These are one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever purchased and needed to write a review. The fit is better than I thought it would be and is surely true to its size. It's a great looking shoe, friends and family like it. Only con is that I have a feeling the foam material will detach from the shoe from the way it looks. Hopefully I'm wrong- I will leave an updated review in a few months if I remember
-Edit: it's been a few months and the shoes are still in great condition. The material kind of absorbs oils so be careful. Other than that, I'd definitely buy another pair. The 8 fit but it was super snug and I didnt like how narrow the part around the heel was. The 8.5, my true size, was perfect. The extra space in the toe area is good for you, for your feet to breathe better. The heel fit better too, even for just a .5 size difference. Don't forget about wearing thick socks in the winter. I tried on thick socks with my true size and the shoes still fit comfortably. Definitely stick with your true size. Love the black/black colorwar... I have the EM version too with the grey.. love these shoes. They are my favorite. Light, comfy, and they look super cool! love these.. big fan of Boost already. That's how good they really are. it's natural and feels good in stride. This is my favorite athletic shoe. Pros:
-Came as Advertised
-Light and Comfortable
-Looks Awesome
-Pricing

Cons:
-Tearing (photo)
-Tongue Sewn Down

Personal Gripe: No Wide Option

My shoe came in an Adidas box and looked exactly as shown. Its a light shoe and comfortable for walking and running. Pricing was better than actual Adidas store and they look awesome. A wide shoe would have been nice but I suggest going up a size to accommodate for wider feet. It will still feel very snug but hopefully they will stretch out over time. Read more I normally purchase a different brand of shoe but liked the look of these. They are much more comfortable then any other sneaker I've worn. I want to say love. but its a running shoe. my feet are wider and i have a high arch, this made the shoe fit a little small. the plastic plate accross the front of the laces is very hard and dug in the first few days. I ordered the size i did because a pair i ordered for christmas at 10.5 was HUGE on me.. these were 10 and felt closer to a 9.5. Overall i have worn these almost every day for the last 2 weeks and do love them for the gym. Look great with anything. Great shoes . I got two pairs, one from amazon, all white ones, in a size 9.5 and the blue,grey ones in a size 9 from a local sports store.

87	27	Adidas Ultra Boost ST	['Textile', 'Rubber sole', 'Upper Material: Primeknit (synthetic)', 'Closure: lace', 'Midsole: Boost foam', 'Sole: Stretchweb rubber', 'Support Type: neutral']	She shoes feels good but the heel cup is non existent so you constantly feel like it's going to fall off. Pretty comfortable and great for people with wider feet, and you can't beat the price, especially since these regularly sell for $200.00. I personally think React is better, if you want an ultra comfortable shoe try the Nike exp-x14, it's like walking on pillows all day, and they only cost like $70.00, and absolutely no foot fatigue at the end of the day, I can't say the same for UltraBoosts, for all the hype around this cushioning technology I expected ALOT more from it but honestly it's just not that comfortable, Tried PureBoost, UltraBoost 4.0, and now these, but my EQT 93/17 are WAY more comfortable then any UltraBoost sneaker I own. So long story short, skip UltraBoost and go to Nike React, or Adidas EQT 93/17, their way more comfortable. The padding at the forefoot feels like they've gone 300-350 miles - as if it is no longer there. Not my favorite Ultraboost or boost sneaker in general. I am not a wide of skinny footer so the product is good for me. The reason to buy these are for comfort in the upper and cushion. The upper seems thicker than the original Ultraboost but still comfortable. I like the traditional tongue set up. Shoe has good lockdown and stability. The boost doesn't seem as good as the original Ultraboost. I got them at a decent price but would only by again if the price dropped lower because there are better boost options. I'm still satisfied with the shoe though. I needed a shoe that would be comfortable, breathable and somewhat stylish. Very good quality shoes, the amount of cushioning is perfect. I also purchased a pair of Adidas tempo 9, and the Ultra Boost st is noticeably better, at least on my feet. These ones seem real to me, no issues with the product whatsoever. i have heard alot about this shoe, but was not able to wrap my head on spending over 150 on it, i finally convinced myself to go in on this investment and i was not disappointed by the shoe, one of the comfiest shoe in the market. Give it a try you wont regret it These shoes are great walking shoes. They fit true to size and fit my size 9 perfectly. They completely did away with my lower/outside leg muscle pain when taking long walks, due to the awesome arch support.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Originals-Mens-Ultraboost-St/dp/B077SJP7LQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077XL9FHX&psc=1
88	28	Merrell Bare Access Flex	['100% Textile and Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Mesh & TPU upper', 'Integrated EVA footbed', 'Stack height 14.2mm', 'Flexconnect technology for stability', 'Breathable mesh lining']	"I am a big Merrell fan and have been wearing their minimalist shoes for years. I loved the Bare Access 2, 3 and 4. (The Bare Access Ultras didn't fit as well.) When they discontinued the Bare Access 4, I tried these. The fit and sole are similar to the Bare Access 4. Unfortunately, none of their minimalist shoes have a good trail tread, but these are better than the tread on typical road shoes. With that said, I recently ran a marathon in a pair of Flex shoes and they were great--very light, with just enough protection underfoot while also still feeling responsive. These shoes seem well suited to running on non-technical trails and pavement. Nonetheless, these are great zero-drop shoes. So, while the original review is accurate in terms of fit and traction, the durability is horrible. I am currently running in a pair of NB Minimus trail shoes that have over 600 miles on them and show very little wear (other than the lugs).

********
My new fave. I run trails a lot and love minimalist shoes. These shoes fit really well, they have enough of a sole to prevent 1"" gravel from being painful, and they are still very light. I also love the traction. I was a little concerned because they don't have lugs, but they actually gave me better traction than my NB Minimus 10V4's and my Merrell Trail Gloves. They are especially good on wet wood, which can be really slick where I run in OH and KY. I bought these after wearing out a pair of Trail Glove 4's that I absolutely loved. Wanted a similar feel with just a little more cushion, but the shoe is certainly not the same design (even though a Merrell rep said they were very similar and with thicker sole). They fit less snug in the mid and heel, and the toe box on the outer side is too slim - it's causing my pinkies to rub during the run - as compared to the TG4. The laces need to be perfectly flat through the grommets or they rub on your top of foot because the tongue is thin. EVERY. BLESSED. STEP. SQUEAK! SQUEAK! SQUEAK! I have three pairs of these shoes and I LOVE them. I have a hard time finding hiking shoes (or any shoes at all for that matter) that fit properly. My biggest challenge and concern when buying shoes for hiking is supporting that ankle. The Trail Gloves are great shoes too and Ive worn them on two Grand Canyon rim to rim hikes but they are so minimally cushioned that I can feel every rock and stone on the trail. Not a deal breaker but I have been wishing for just a little more protection. Now that wish has come true. These shoes are the perfect combination of good protection for my feet but not so much cushion that my ankle instability is exacerbated. Super comfy for just wearing around. Light and cool and they feel like slippers. I wear them at work where I spend a lot of time on my feet (6-8 hours a day sometimes) and cant wait to get them into the Grand Canyon this spring. Read more Used them in an organized 1/2 marathon race and they worked fine. I switched to Merrell shoes 5 years back and since then these are my favorite. I got a pair of Bare Access Flex Trail Runner shoes about a month ago and since these are Merrell - the fit and comfort was perfect for me. Although I love Merrell, I would recommend against buying this specific model and looking for a better reviewed one instead."	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Access-Trail-Runner/dp/B01MZBVZH5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07KG1LLDG&psc=1

Inov-8 states this is a true multi-terrain shoe, which is the main reason I got them. BUT, due to the extra protection around the toe and along the sides, and the close knit fabric....all which do protect against rocks and moisture getting into shoe, water can not easily get out. HOT
Now, the upper is super solid, and would likely keep things out of the shoe and appears to be very durable. I love Inov-8s, and would love to have the RocLite 290 traction appear on low-drop model with true ""standard"" wide fit like the Terraclaw 220, Trailtalon 250, or even the X-talon 200 frame. Overall, if you have a narrower foot, are in cooler environments, avoid water and don't mind the non-trail tongue with stuff getting into your shoe, this is a great shoe. Just does not work for my needs, nor do I feel is properly described by Inov-8 as a ""standard fit multi-terrain"" shoe. I've been an avid Inov-8 trail runner for over 10 years. I strapped these puppies on and pumped put a fast 2 mile trail and loved them instantly. They felt great, true to fit and exactly how I expect shoes from Inov-8 to feel out of the box. The roclite series are perfect all around shoes for varying trail types and they never dissapoint. For some people it seems like half a size is enough. Fit: Good arch support and heel cup. The upper is also not too high so if hugs the foot well: although there is room around the toes, I didn't notice fore/aft motion of the foot inside the shoe. That point is important personally as otherwise blisters are more frequent as a result of running downhill. Traction: Really impressed by the cleats/studs. It has handled everything on that run: rocks, mud, roots, all of that on steep sections, and I've more confident than with any other shoe before. Protection: I was concerned about the mid-sole because it seemed on the thinner side (13.5mm in the front) but it did amazingly well. My feet were not sore at all after the run (cant say the same about the quads!). Stepped on quite a few rocks and didn't feel a thing, or rather, I felt that the shoe handled them well. Durability: I rinsed the shoes and let them dry after use, and they look like I haven't worn them. It's only one run, but still encouraging. I suppose the mesh helps with breath-ability in hot/dry weather, but I wish the material was a bit more like the sides (water-repellent coating). The shoe did take some time to dry at home, and although it got wet during the run it didn't bother me at all. I like that these are pretty light, they're sturdy and protect my foot from the rocks and roots of the trails, and they're very grippy, even on wet rocks. Unfortunately, the toe box is pretty tight, especially compared to other Inov-8 shoes I've had. They're fine for shorter runs, but for those really long runs, they start to cause blisters on my toes. If they could combine the grippiness with a more comfortable toe box, this would be a great shoe. This pair had been recommended by the website outdoor gear research lab and AMZ was the only place where I could find this very model. This is a good hybrid road/trail running and it's got the right amount of cushioning... don't think it'll be waterproof like GTX shoes, but it's extremely comfortable, the laces don't come undone, and it's the right balance of weight and comfort. Overall a good buy for casual runners, and possibly more active runners. First off this is a really nice dual road/trail shoe. If you are used to pure running shoes it might feel a little stiff but , still pretty light. Second, the color I got is the blue which is the blue true to the on-line color and not to blue for a guy. Third, I normally wear a 101/2 but ordered 11 and they fit perfect. Finally, they were a good price."	https://www.amazon.com/Inov-8-Mens-Roclite-Trail-Runner/dp/B01G4YKJ6U?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01IK1MVTS&psc=1

91	1	Saucony Freedom ISO 2	['Rubber sole']	If you liked the first edition of Freedoms, youll like these. Sizing is truer and there is more padding on the upper ISO. Same Everun sole with the 4 mm drop. Good shoe. I didn't know what to expect when I received my Saucony Freedom ISO 2, as I has always ran in Saucony Guides. However, once I put these on, I was blown away how comfortable, light and flexible these shoes are. I did replace the paper thin insole with an Aetrex insole and now it feels like i'm running on pillows. I highly recommend giving them a shot. I found this shoe was near perfect at about a 6:30 - 7:00 minute mile pace. I believe this is because of the everun foam which seems like heaven at the right cadence (not crazy fast, but not slow). This shoe is great for 10k to half marathon pacing. I am giving the shoe 5 stars because the above description is exactly what I was looking for. The Saucony Freedom ISO 2 is definitely going in the rotation. I highly recommend this shoe, especially for your long tempo run on the weekends. As an added benefit, the toebox on these is plenty roomy (this can only help as I try not to continue beating the crap out of my toes which ultimately, I attribute to mileage and technique, more than any shoe) and I'm digging the ISO fit, which I also have on my trail shoes. Very nice looking shoes. The senakers feel really comfortable and lightweight. I will not count the damage of the box on this review because it did not affect the shoes at all. Much lighter than my previous Saucony Ride ISO's but just as comfortable. Very soft...I've seen some say too soft at the back/heal but so far everything's going okay. The best fitted I have bought. Best Cushioning shoe I have ever worn. So good that I bought two pair!	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Freedom-ISO-2-Mens/dp/B0179WKEWA?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CP849KN&psc=1
92	2	New Balance 880 v8	['Free Expedited Shipping!', '10 D', 'New Balance']	The shoes were true to size and well cushioned as represented. Took them out of the box on vacation and walked 4 plus miles a day on concrete comfortably. It was a good purchase. Has assisted in comfort in feet with plantar fasciitis Bought these elsewhere as the style has changed, but this is one superior running shoe. They fit as expected (9 2E) and are extremely light and comfortable. I only run on a treadmill now in my house and these allowed me to increase my speed and distance the first morning due to the lightness of the shoe. Don't know how they would hold up on pavement but for treadmill running (I'm 72) they are OUTSTANDING!	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Mens-880v8-Running/dp/B07D8B4P6Y?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07J2YPHV3&psc=1

94	4	New Balance 890 v6	['Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', '6 Mm Drop**', 'Bootie Construction', 'Engineered Mesh', 'No-Sew Material Application']	I almost love this shoe. However, I have very high arches and the 890 doesn't quite give me enough support. The D width hugs my narrow foot, this is almost a match. If you want a shoe that guides you away from pronation but doesn't have pronounced arch support. With just a little more arch support, this shoe would mimic my all time favorite, the NB 1260v3. I don't want to return this attractive shoe, but I know that I'll be sorry after a couple of weeks of running. Please note that I am an extremely picky guy when it comes to running shoes. If you have a narrow foot, you might love the 890. I've had several pairs V3-V5 and LOVED the shoe. Love 'em. It's like they slightly narrowed the toe box and widened the heel section. They still fit, just not as well. I probably would not have even noticed had I not worn them running back to back with the previous version. I'm still going to use the 890v6 exclusively but I think I might put the v5's on a shelf and use them only occasionally to remind myself what true foot perfection feels like. They were foot perfection as well as extremely durable. Now almost the whole shoe is constructed of thin mesh like material instead of more durable fabrics. I understand that it probably promotes air circulation but it's not very durable. I have loved the previous versions like no other and especially for its lightweight. Not a bad sneaker but not the feel of the previous version. It was disappointing since I have been faithful and loved this version for the past ten years. Great shoe. Felt a little small out of the box, but adjusted nicely over the past 5 miles and fits very comfortably now. These shoes are awesome. Fit as advertised!. I loved these so much, I bought a second pair!. They feel great and were my go to shoes when I was a heavy runner. I have a bad right knee with ACL reconstructed and 60% meniscus removed so I needed a good support for running. This NB running ahoe was ranked among top 5 in an article. Although it fit nice it wasn't very comfortable for long runs. I used for 2 months, ran a 13.1 in 2.11, but didn't really feel very comfortable and stability, comfort and support was not up to my liking. I am going to stick to Asics for my runs and use this casually for walks and theme park visits. I am using them on the treadmill and they are comfortable and offer very good arch support	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Mens-890v6-Running/dp/B075R78HYX?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B072C4696D&psc=1

No support, very stiff, unwearable. Its much less flexible and the sole of the shoe is less cushioned. Also the back of the shoe is stiffer as well. For those of you who liked to fold down the back of the shoe and slip on the 3.0s and 4.0s, this shoe will let you do it, but barely (the 2017 wouldn't at all). There is more arch support in this shoe than any other Free I've worn. In fact, it feels like its boat shaped; like a Hoka or something. I don't mind this as it feels supportive and makes me walk less flat footed. Overall this is a good shoe; not as good as the 3.0s and 4.0s, but wearable. The one consolation is that this shoe is better for running than the 3.0 and 4.0s were. Sizing is the same as all other Frees. TLDR version: if you liked the 3.0 and 4.0 versions for their flexibility and plan on wearing these casually, you might be a bit disappointed by the lack of ""Free""dom. If you want a good running shoe with some flexibility, they are likely a good fit. Still very comfortable and light feeling, but I think they've made the soles sturdier, with a bit more arch support. Nothing flashy/colorful on this version - which makes it easy to wear to different events as a comfortable shoe and not just for athletics. I like the flex of the material over the toes in particular so there isn't any hard pressure on them. Laces appear to be stronger in terms of the attachments, but it's also harder to lace up and a bit less comfortable as a result. A great value vs the usual list price - but pricing seems to be all over the map based on color/size. They're good for about 300 miles of tread, then they breakdown pretty rapidly. But, I like them because they're light, and require zero break-in time, unlike a lot of other brands of Running Shoes. His feet must be spreading out because the 12.5W was too small but everything else about the shoe was perfect. Contacted Amazon & returned shoes without any hassle. This results in feeling the cliff between the edge of the sole and the bottom of the shoe constantly throughout the day. The most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. I have a lot of musculoskeletal issues, so I really need a good support shoe. I have had them for about a year not and am completely satisfied. Hope my next pair will be just like that. Looks great but kind of more narrow than expected. Good shoe, little tight on the sides but I have a wide foot.

This is my 7th pair of Altras and I have absolutely loved every pair...until now. Based on recommendations I order 1/2 size small which was good. the size was perfect however the shoe rides quite hit on the achilles and it rubbed constantly to the point I had to pad it with moleskin. The shoes were relatively comfortable but not as comfortable as my original Torin 2.5. They expanded to the seams) After less than 1 month of wearing it looks like a ran through a glass factory. I normally get 200+ out of Torins and most other top brands before replacement. Unless Altra updates these, I am back to Hokas when I need a high-cushioned break from my trusty Torins. The sole support is very cushion(y), but I did not wear them for more than 5 mins as I returned them because my Podiatrist didn't approve of them. He recommended the Brooks Beast 18 or Adrenaline or the Hoka Clifton 5 or Bondi 5
I have ordered a pair of Altra Olympus 3 Altra and I have been told they are a harder sole and have more durable uppers. I like the Altra philosophy for designing shoes and I hope these turn out to be true to the designers description, I am planning on keeping them and using them for the suggest two weeks (by Altra) regardless. Soles need to have body and support along with cushioning. Companies really like to throw around a ton of non-applicable feature descriptions (marketing) that have no engineering basis. Shoes need to be balanced with a firm sole to be effective first and foremost. Their entire line of shoes are amazing and had I used them long ago when I was a serious runner unlike today I may have broken many PRs because the miles I may have been able to tolerate. The whole idea of a wide toebox is really the key because your feet are allowed to move as intended comfortably without being crunched up like an illegal stashed in a hidden compartment, absolutely amazing shoe and brand. The shoes work well for me since I have very wide feet. If this were improved, I think that they would be very good shoes for me. Both of my little toes have been blister free since I started using the Altra Duos. Amazon was very helpful with the return and my money was refunded. Love Altras, but not these

Toe box is wider than other road altra shoes and they feel like a half size too big. Could not get these to fit without slipping in the heal or making the laces too tight.

It's like running on pillows. I ordered a half size larger than usual (I normally wear a 10, I ordered a 10.5 and they fit perfectly) on the recommendation of other Amazon reviews. I may order a second pair due to how much I love these. I love this shoe. Everything about it, the price, the comfort, and looks. I am a runner and have been running about 4-5 years and these by far are some of the best running shoes Ive run it. They are cheap and beautiful looking shoes. I have about 100 miles on mine right now and they show no sign of wear or tear on the clear rubber outsole which is amazing and I didnt expect for it to hold up this well. Good job Suacony. Very comfortable and breathable pair of shoes. They look great as well, only complaint would be that the toe box was tight at first, but then it stretched. Would recommend these shoes. This is my 4th pair and it's one of my favorite running shoes of all time. Personally the heel drop is more than I'd like, that's on me, should've done more research before ordering online. I did however expect better quality from such a reputable company. Might just be my pair but ultimately I wish I could return them. I love Saucony bc they fit my wide toe box so well, but this shoe is super-duper lacking in support. They look amazing. They fit well. But they absolutely require an orthopedic insert...I wish they'd stated that somewhere.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Freedom-Iso-Unisex-Road-Running-Shoes/dp/B072JMYPMS?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071WCHVFQ&psc=1

They fit perfectly. A bit too tight over the top of the foot and recommended buying up a half size, but Ayer a few weeks that loosened up to where the fit is fantastic. They look great, feel great, and perform great. Overall I really like these shoes. They are very easy on/off and the laceless design is great. The support is excellent and the fit around the ankle is tight enough to keep debris out. Putting them on feels a bit like slipping into a wetsuit bootie. However for all-day comfort you might want to buy up about half a size Initially, I tried these shoes at my size on Prime Wardrobe. A stellar shoe when you find the right fit. PROS:
- Beautiful, sleek knit design.
- Hugs your foot.
- Superb Boost cushioning.
- Feels heavenly without socks.
- Laceless. Leaving marks like sock indentations. Read more Very very comfortable. Purchased for a three day music festival (Coachella) knowing Id be on my feet for the duration of the event. This will fit snug at first but will loosen/stretch over a few wearing. Awesome. Super comfortable, great look. I think these run a bit big - I always wear a size 9 in shoes and sneakers (I usually do wear New Balance) - but for these an 8.5 fit better. I still got the nine because I was afraid of the shoes being too small, and there is a good amount of extra length in the toe box. It's ok, they still are super comfortable but I don't run in them. Too pretty. Happy with fit (they are a bit narrow, but i like my shoes a bit on the tight side anyway). Hope they hold up for many more miles as i really like these shoes. I liked them so much I ordered a second pair, which I never do. I stand on a concrete floor all day and have been in these quite a bit over the three weeks I have had them and feel they work pretty well as an everyday wear shoe too.

They are very well cushioned but not ""marshmallow soft"", supportive and look great with almost any athletic or even casual sportswear. I really, really, like these shoes. My hisband loves these shoes, we got him this pair for his birthday. As we grow older, we tend to forego style for comfort. Good job Brooks, I will continue to buy from you guys, as long as you continue to make good shoes. Whilst in the midst of getting back into healthy better safer shape & for the last year or two, whenever I shop around/browse for sneakers, I REALLY take my time, looking for the absolute best pairs for easier walking, & my knee/back pain, Ive had to read many, many reviews, read ALL of the descriptions & specs, & take notes and compare etc. So w/ all of the legwork I put in, & of course a bit of good luck, I chose so wisely. I honestly dont have any cons to write about these. Not days or weeks, but in just a few mere days, I was so thrilled that I chose this pair. The aesthetic is pleasing, and the build quality is maybe the best Ive ever purchased. I still think theyre all terrific, but Im looking forward to sticking w/ Brooks for the foreseeable future. What w/ theyre rep for quality durability & comfort, and my new attesting to the fact, its a no-brainer. So, like me if youve never had Brooks, I say- DEFINATELY, go for it. Plus most purchases are returnable, really youve nothing to lose. This Brooks shoes are exactly what he was looking for; he is very comfortable in them and wears them all the time and gets lots of compliments. If you want shoes with wider toe box this brand is the answer. Brooks makes many good looking running shoes. These are neutral or normal stride, which I am, if you are this style is perfect. They are light like many shoes out now but, there is something in the construction that make your not so sore after 10 hours of standing at work. For weekend 1/2 day excisions in the trails your feet aren't a wet sweaty mess. Worth the extra money because construction distributes the load. Tread or sole's seem to be strong yet soft, hope to get many miles from these. These are great. I wasnt sure if this new model would be as good as the Launch, but I figured Id give them a try. Turns out they are great. Fit: I wear 8.5 or 9 medium in dress and casual shoes. I bought a 9.5 in these per usual with trainers and they fit perfectly. The midfoot design is excellent, works like a support saddle to really secure my arches. Support and Cushion: Solid and sturdy with lots of arch support. I use orthotic inserts in all my shoes and they fit in these very nicely. The stock insole is easy to remove and replace. Breathability: Excellent due to a woven mesh upper. Construction: Appears solid. Price: Very good on sale. Overall: 5 stars, great shoes for running or gym use. Brooks has become my favorite brand of athletic shoe, surpassing any other kind I have tried in comfort and support as well as fit. I believe the shoe is better for short distance running or a HIIT type workout versus long distance runs.

In a last-minute rush, I ordered these and got them the night before a Spartan Super Race. I tried them on that night and they fit well. I ended up doing over 8 miles in them that day and the traction was excellent. The quality combined with a low price make these and excellent choice if youre on a budget. I'm familiar with plenty of Adidas terrex type shoes and this is definitely among the stiffer and less forgiving shoes. It's not a huge difference, but you notice that your steps hit the ground a little harder with this one and it's hard not to prefer a more comfortable shoe upon impact. But it seems like a great shoe and maybe someone wants it a little harder than the other terrex shoes. The sneaker looks better in person. It looks good on my feet. Its a trekking sneaker so its stronger then a regular sneaker. The traction is pretty good. I love trekking and I wish I bought these sooner. Its more comfortable then wearing my Timberlands and I love my Timberlands. Im in the Philippines and the weather here is always sunny so I was not able to test if it was really water resistant or water proof. These shoes did exactly as I hoped. Plenty of grip for slippery situations and they are really comfortable. I wear a size 12-13 depending on the shoe brand and these size 12 were a perfect fit.I really like these shoes and plan on getting another pair at some point. He loves them. No need to break them in - he immediately wore them on a short hike and said they were very comfortable. He loved his pair so much that I ordered the womens for myself. We have other pairs of adidas that are a size smaller than our normal tennis shoe size, so we think adidas shoes just tend to run a little larger. (Husband wears an 11 in Nike & a 10.5 in adidas.) I'm a woman with wide feed and its hard to find an attractive and appropriate shoe for my activities. I'm outdoors a lot, landscaping, running, hiking, and I run a dog shelter so these are perfect for my lifestyle. Fantastic grip, water resistant, extremely durable, and comfortable. Fit perfect right out of the box.

I have other shoes that let my foot move around a lot, and they still dont tough the tip of my big toe. (running shoes). They're BARELY long enough to not irritate my toes in the length.... Build quality seems nice of course... grip is good. etc. The price point is high, but if you think about how long they last youre getting your moneys worth. So paying $129 for the Salomons which I know will last me over 2 years, the money is worth it. They are comfortable and wear well with most clothes. Additionally, the Goretex waterproofing is awesome. I will continue to purchase these shoes as long as their current standards hold true. My Salomon XA Pro 3D GTX trail shoes are fantastic. I love the look, the grip on the trail, and that it's waterproof with the Gore-Tex waterproof membrane. Once I loosened the laces a bit I was fine. I love the grip I have with these shoes. The trail can be an evolving situation, so I'm glad that these shoes have the necessary grip for a variety of circumstances. The insoles are more supportive than I expected, which is a plus for me. I'm very happy with my purchase, and definitely recommend these shoes. I bought these sneakers because I have a boot by salomon with the same sole, and I liked how well they performed. Great shoe. It is too heavy for good running but provides excellent protection for trails and the like. I found the bottom to be hard and mediocre in cushioning comfort. The speed-laces are nice but I hope they will last with the constant abrasion from tightening and loosening. I presently use them as daily footwear with tactical cargo pants and find them better looking than tactical boots. The most comfortable shoes ever. So far they are still comfortable after owning them for 4 month and wearing them about 13 to 15 hours a day about 5 times a week. They are easy to clean. They fit pretty regular true to size for me. I love the lace system on them for easy on and off. This is just my opinion- these are far more superior then any other brand	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-Pro-Trail-Runner/dp/B073S7B7DL?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07QCD2RNJ&psc=1

First impression out the box: this is a damn good looking running shoe (truth be told I really like grey herringbone patterns)
First impression on my feet: very comfortable, true to size and again they look really good
First impression on the street while jogging: nothing special, lacking a bit in the ankle support department but nothing detrimental, not too heavy and a bit more padding and cushion than my old Nikes I really wanted to like this shoe for the price. Good looking shoe. I will always buy Adidas but never another Duramo model don't get me wrong, I love the shoes, they are about the right size, save for one thing. The tongue.. it rubs and bruises the top of my foot where it begins (both feet). The shoes fit perfectly fine and feel great until you stand then it pulls tight and the pain happens... I wish there was some way to loosen that part of the shoe up or pad it...I have to give a 3 star to an otherwise excellent shoe There's really no way to downgrade the product, as it is what it is. It's shortcomings are not the fault of the seller, but inherent in the design. I bought these shoes after reading an article that listed a variety of shoes that were considered good for large runners. Again, and this is important to understand. It's the design of the shoe, not the seller that creates this perfect storm of awkward fit. Expect your heel to slip a bit, especially since you cannot rig the laces snug up the heel cup. The shoes arrived quickly and in perfect condition. I'm looking for a more robust lace that matches or compliments the shoe color, so I can snug these up better. There are what amounts to extra eyelets (can't really tell if they were intended to be decorative or useful, but the provided lace length is too short to employ them. These fit the same as other adidas running shoes I have. Ive worn these for over a week and really like them. The little padding on both sides of the back is a nice bit of extra protection. I bought these for my son and he loves them. He said they are very comfortable and fit as expected. I loved the price. I would recommend these shoes. A good consistent look all grey almost like a shoe instead of a sneaker. Good comfortable support for the foot. Takes some wearing till the upper part softens a little bit and stops pressing against the ankle and top of the foot. Hopefully they are actually strong and long lasting."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Duramo-9/dp/B07D9KYTSY?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077XHMZJT&psc=1

I owned a pair Adios 1 and the fit is extremely superior on the Adios 4, I felt it from the moment I put them in to try them. It holds your mid foot perfectly without been too tight so it offers a fit that feels like you don't need the laces although laces are great. My only concern, and it is completely personal is that I bought this for the running segment of sprint and olympic distance triathlons, but since the tongue is stitched to the sides( and don't get me wrong, this provides that great midfoot fit I mentioned before), the entry of the shoes is a little tight, so for the transitions it might be a little hard to get them in fast with elastic laces. If this were for ""normal"" running this will be just perfect so 5 stars for them."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Adizero-Adios-4/dp/B07D9PPJ7J?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D9H4ZM8&psc=1

One of my favorite pairs, but with a major ""but""

Would be 5 stars if it weren't for how delicate the mesh toe box was. Mine tore, leaving a nice and noticeable 3/4"" gash that opens up visibly while walking. There is an inner lining, so this does not affect function.. but it does make a pair of trainers that was worn maybe 5 times look like an old pair. If i were using these rough, and dragged it through a bramble bush, or got it caught under a fridge kick-panel, etc... wouldn't be complaining about this. Looked, and sure enough - looks like a nice slice in the outer mesh cover. Nonetheless, this is one of my favorite pairs of trainers/runners. These shoes are probably the most comfortable shoes i've ever had. I also like the fact that the bottom grip padding that makes contact with the ground is one whole piece. I've learned years ago that when there's a bunch of little pieces/sections all glued to the bottom, those little pieces end up falling off and you can never find adhesive that's strong enough to stick them back on. The rest of the shoe is made out of some kind of light and elastic material that's very comfortable. Overall very happy after my first day of use. Original post:
These are pretty awesome shoes. This is my first pair of Under Armor shoes so I went to try them on first in a store, to be sure I would get the right size. For those that are not sure about the size to get, Ive found them to size about the same as Nike for me, which is 1/2 size larger than New Balance and ASICS. I like the look of the shoe, it is lightweight and the length was perfect, but not a very wide fitting shoe. Unfortunately I will be returning them, though I wish I didnt have to. Not entirely certain if these fit correctly, but I believe so. The top material looks well put together, but the glue all around the bottom of the shoes is pretty noticeable and the bottoms are terribly stiff. I think it would have been worth spending the extra money on a better pair, though these were just for him to wear to work. All in all, they look okay, but don't seem to be very comfortable or flexible. I love these sneakers. The white and black is a great color combination. They have nice arch support and are very comfortable. If you have a medium width foot - these will fit great. When I purchased mine they were priced a little over $40 which was a great value. I'd definitely buy these again. After a full week of use, I am definitely happy with the transaction to grab these babies. Good looking and super comfortable both. Lightweight with decent cushion, but also seem constructed well enough for at least 3 to 4 years of regular use. I'll report back if they dont hold up as I am giving them lightweight use (not running in them). Great with a pair of black ankle socks. Interesting to note that they def run small"	https://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Micro-Pursuit-Running/dp/B071HLS5VC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07P128ND7&psc=1

I'm flat footed and suffer from Plantar Fasciitis and need good arch support. Has a soft sole with little arch support. I have always loved Asics. Finally - after ordering 2 other pairs of ASICS from Amazon the exact same size of my other 4 pairs I got one that fit. The look is good and the cushioning is nice. Stay away from this shoe if you are looking for support. But all the fluffy language describing it to have great arch and ankle support is a complete lie. Its flat with no support whatsoever. Your feet dont sit right in the shoes, and certain parts of the show are tighter than others . And apparently according to Amazon you cant return them see photo The first time I wore them, they were a bit more snug than other pairs of Exalts I've had, and they were tighter than the multiple pairs of Contends that I've been wearing for years. I haven't worn them for long periods of time yet, so that's next up on the to-do list. Never tried the Asics brand before but certainly know they are a reputable brand. These shoes were light and a little less cushion which I knew, but they were wide in the mid and forefoot which caused more movement then I would like in a shoe. Big Ascic fan but this shoe was unspectaular...fit a little too narrow...length perfect...looks OK... just an OK shoe....got what I paid for I guess..... Update 2 weeks....much happier...shoes streched in width...not too tight...fits great, Achilles great fit...much happier with this reasonably priced gel shoe...I will remain big Asics fan...	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Exalt-Running-Shoe/dp/B07H4YYYS6?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071FD3RT1&psc=1

Love the styling of the Pegasus Shield and the fit was as good if not better than the Lunar Glide and I have wide feet. Bonus was the lace system. Its more of a thin cord, spring-loaded cincher, that actually good on the bottom lace. It was a Christmas gift, and you know risky it is to give shoes as a present. But the feedback I received was ""It is the best present ever!!!"". They are really waterproof, keep warmth well, and are very comfortable. I want those for myself now! =) Our son runs about 10 miles every day; told me these were the running shoe to dream for.

115	25	Nike Air Zoom Terra Kiger 4	['Synthetic', '100% AUTHENTIC', 'BRAND NEW IN BOX', '880563-001']	Ive always thought of Nike as more of a fashion sneaker or good basketball/ soccer/ football shoe. The graphic design is actually very attractive and the online image does not do it justice. Cannot comment on the comfortability or trail adaptability because I have not worn them myself but I do trust they will last. I loved these shoes, till the left shoe's lacing system came off. Incredible kicks love them Lifelong runner. It has tremendous cushioning and comfort. But credit goes to Nike for decades of pioneering shoe design in the post barefoot era. This shoe is the crowning achievement of a global enterprise and all the passion of running. Comfortable and very lightweight for trail runners. Excellent traction even in loose stuff over hard pack in hilly (Oakland Hills Range) terrain. The Soles are clearly designed for running off pavement. Most comfortable trail shoes I have worn. I like them better then my Solomon's Speedcross 3's or my Adidias Terrex Great for hiking when a heavy boot isn't needed.	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Terra-Kiger-Trail-Running/dp/B06XKQS9NJ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BRYY5J8&psc=1

The cushion has a little more give than Nimbus (a plus) and I think the ventilation is better. I've only run in these for a week, so the verdict is still out. Overall, they've made a great first impression. I can honestly say the toe box on these running shoes is too narrow. It pinches and feels like I've put my normal width feet into a narrow shoe. I've had perfectly normal toe width previous running shoes from Asics, Saucony, others, and most recently New Balance. They make a good Running shoe. This model I orfered just for everyday wear (GT-1000 7) and it was definitely sized different. They were pretty snug so I sent them back and got a half size larger. Update: changing this from 3 to 4 stars. 5 stars for Amazon service. 3 stars for ASICS sizing consistency. I exchanged them for a half size larger than original and while they do fit, honestly if I was going to run in these I would send them back again and get a full size larger than what I usually wear in ASICS. This product was quite satisfactory, sole did not seem quite as rigid as the other gt1000 models all proceeding the ""-7"" model. The sole rigidity issue was resolved after adding the superfeet insoles and these shoes are now performing very well. They were terrific. However, I now have a job which requires me to be on my feet for long periods of time, and to remain in good shape. Right off the bat, the Asics GT10000 7's did the trick, and look good with everything from sweats to jeans. Been wearing the shoes for a couple miles already and I must say I am impressed. The reviews I read say the shoe fits narrow which I can agree with but not in the toe. The toe box is perfect (and I usually wear a wide) but its narrow running up the foot which is actually not bad. My ankles feel supported enough to run without being over bearing and they breathe well. Just stick with the Asics and you wont be disappointed. ZERO! The stability of these shoes are really great, you can really feel the sturdiness of the shoe. I usually just went for whatever looked nice. I've only had it for a day but so far I'm liking it, the quality is definitely there and it's a very snug shoe, which is a good thing. It's very stiff and rigid too, which I assume helps guide you feet. Great running shoe. Light and with great cushion. Really good deal in terms of quality/price. It did quite a difference versus my previous running shoe (as well ASICS but much heavier and with less cushion) as I improved my time by 30s/mile on my usual 8 miles run."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-GT-1000-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B07F3DH2JZ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07DFWGKGN&psc=1
117	27	Saucony Ride ISO		Comparing the two models, the Ride 10 doesn't hold anything to the Ride ISO. The comfort of the Ride ISO is significantly improved over the Ride 10. The split upper of the shoe makes a huge difference in the comfort while running. I haven't had the opportunity to use them on a longer run just yet, but I'm confident they will be more comfortable than the Ride 10 pair. I look forward to enjoying these and likely purchasing another pair. I was in need of new running shoes and these had great reviews. I wouldn't say font buy these shoes, because they are good quality...but then again for the price, you may want to stick with your go-to brand instead of hopping over to these. I used to run in the Triumph ISO 2. Overall quality, design, fit seemed decent otherwise, but this is an arbitrary 4 star rating since I'm returning immediately. Read a lot of positive reviews for these shoes. They fit well, however. Great show. Comfortable and durable for marathon training. And they are great. Fit well. Firm and supportive in all the right places. I am a big fan. Great for running. They always hold up well. Im glad I found this brand. Perfect fit!	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Ride-ISO-Mens/dp/B07D7QR7VH?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BN49RPF&psc=1
118	28	Adidas Questar Ride	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Runner type: Neutral shoes offer flexibility and versatility, with premium cushioning; Weight: 10 ounces (size 9); Midsole drop: 11.5 mm (heel: 24.5 mm / forefoot: 13 mm)', 'Two-tone mesh upper for breathability', 'Supportive heel construction designed to enable the free motion of the Achilles tendon', '', '']	When trying them on, the tongue is very narrow and doesn't cover the gap between the tongue and upper very well. There is no arch support what so ever. Best running shoes I've had to date. I've run in New Balance, Fila (horrible), Reebok, and various Adidas, and these are by far the best I've worn. Super lightweight; soles are cushioning, but not squishy; soles don't pick up pebbles like some Reeboks do; no rubbing on the back of my ankles. I ordered these shoes expecting to send them back, but my son loves them. Very comfortable and light. I use it for work and helps me stay on my feet all day without pain. Side support is lacking, if you want to use for play other than running. Nice pull on tabs. I like this shoe and I am hard to please. My ankles haven't hurt yet and my feet are not screaming. have worn them with and without socks; seams not rubbing. I bought the grey versions of these shoes and they fit perfect but these seem to run a little bigger probably half size bigger... I dont know why but they still fit. I've been a loyal Adidas wearer for, approaching, 30 years. Zero arch support. Product arrived in perfect condition but in a different box because the original shoe box was damaged in transit. a nice note to let us know though so I appreciated that they didn't just send us a shredded shoe box. My husband said they are extremely comfortable. So if you like the style I suggest you buy.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Questar-Ride-Running/dp/B077XLRWVQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0716YF73L&psc=1
119	29	Asics GT 1000 4	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately Low-Top"" from arch', 'Stability running shoe engineered to support overpronation featuring breathable mesh overlay and glossy side logos', 'Rearfoot and forefoot GEL cushioning', 'DuoMax support', '', '']"	"Great shoes. A perfect blend of mild support and flexibility. The cushioning is great for any kind of run. They look great, both stylish and functional. Extremely comfortable. These shoes work perfectly for both of us. I love that Asics still makes all black shoes, it is hard to find nice looking all black, quality running shoes. I simply love my ASICS that I bought two pairs of the same ones. One lesson I learned when purchasing these shoes is that once you find something that fits you really well, go out and get a few more pairs to add to your inventory before they are discontinued. Good, solid, reliable training and even racing shoe. The Asics GT 1000 4 (and 3 and 2 and 1) have provided the support and cushion I've needed without being unbearably heavy. The GT 1000 4 won't last forever, but it'll give you good runs for your money for 3-4 months at a time. I've never been disappointed with Asics. So far, these shoes haven't ""wowed"" me, but they are comfortable and I think they will serve me well. I also got them for a good price, comparatively speaking. These shoes help with those issues. I ""fitness walk"" (walk as fast as I can) around 3 miles a day. Even after I use up the ""workout life"" of my Asics, I still wear them for general use and still notice a substantial difference in comfort over shoes of other brands, though I certainly have not tried a lot of other brands, especially in recent years (mostly shoes my son wears for a while and then gets tired of). In summary, I got this shoe for $70, have found it to be of the quality and comfort I expect from Asics (which are high expectations) and expect to be well-satisfied as time goes on (just got them and have only worn them a few times). Bought these for my Dad who works all day at a big box store and struggles to find shoes comfortable enough to walk the aisles (10 miles a day). He is normally wears a full size smaller (an 11 in New Balance), but a 12 in these fits perfectly. Very happy with our purchase. First, I'd like to say I wear athletic orthotics (A Lines) as I have extremely high arches. Second, not only do these shoes look good but, right out of the box they're very comfortable to wear for several hours. I also have an issue with my right foot (Plantar tendon) I believe and for the money they're awesome. I would say stick to your correct size and get the proper width and you'll be happy. I'm giving them 5 stars for now but, I've only wore them a few days. They support across the bottom of the foot is even and makes a great deal of sense - no weird feelings of gaps in support like the Kayano 23's. I went with Brooks running shoes instead and they're like running on a cloud. These had a far closer to natural feeling but it just wasn't ""right"" for me. I decided to return these and see if the Kayano 23's were a happy medium, but, as elluded to above, they have this feeling of gaps in in support in the middle. I would say these would be great running shoes for on-track or any environment where the ground gives a little. Nicely made, though. Have owned Asics shoes in the past and they were always comfortable. Was looking for an inexpensive pair of shoes that provided good arch support and these seemed just right. I have flat feet and need really good arch support. I was glad to see these come in 2E as well which is more comfortable for me. The arch support is adequate for my needs. I would say this is a good shoe for somebody with mild to moderate overpronation . They are very comfortable and I can wear them all day.

120	0	Asics Gel Quantum 360	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Lightweight running shoe featuring FluidFit mesh upper with reinforcing overlays and rearfoot and forefoot GEL Cushioning System', 'Heel Clutching System', 'Weight-reducing Trusstic System']	"ORIGINAL COMMENT:
I ordered these shoes for my son in May and he loves them. They are excellently made and very comfortable. That should have been my first clue; when something seems too good to be true, it usually is. The fabric on the top of the shoe is not the mesh fabric of the original - in fact, it's not a woven fabric at all. On the original, the Asics ""line"" logos on the sides of the shoe are a shiny, rubbery type of applied finish; on this shoe they are printed on the fabric. BUYER BEWARE!
Read more Very nice looking shoes and they fit as expected in my case. I am a huge fan of the Gel Nimbus line and decided to try these. My first impression was I couldn't believe how soft and comfortable these shoes were. These shoes are so comfortable. Shoes fit well, only issue I have is after wearing them for a little while(few hours) on a hard service, bought them for work, they kill my heels, but great for working out at the gym. Over all, I do like the shoes, but will not purchase them again. Among all the brands, I would choose Asics, Brooks, and Mizunos as my top three. As expected with Asics, they were comfortable. I've ran so far close to 50 miles, on a concrete road to a trail like road. If you're looking to use these for short to longer distance running, they are perfect. These shoes are so much better than I had expected. They slip off like a charm when I come home at the end of the day without untying the shoe laces. They fit so perfectly, it's almost like my FEET have been reshaped to take on more agile and nimble tasks. These shoes feel like they're starting to stretch enough to be fully comfortable, but they're going to feel snug for a while if you have wide feet. I bought the 2015 NYC marathon ""graffiti shoe"" a couple of years ago in the same size (US 9.5) and they stretched within a few weeks to fit beautifully. If you have extremely flat feet like me and need a comfortable shoe to depend on look straight to Asics. I've tried a lot of shoes (and a few shoe insoles) and Asics is unbelievable in the quality of their shoes (coming from a nineteen year old who is about 200-220lbs and is constantly walking on his feet at work). It's like a durable and flexible net style that bends perfectly with the wearer's feet."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-GEL-Quantum-Running-Shoe/dp/B00ZAV3OPW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00UTNP2FG&psc=1

I might like these more if I bought a wider shoe, because the cushion is pretty good and they feel fine once the few pressure points in the front stretch out. He loves them. He says they are the most comfortable shoes hes ever owned. He also loves that he doesnt have to tie them. I like the shoes, but I may need an insert for comfort. Excellent thats all i have to say. Stable , light and comfortable Great mountain running shoe. Very protective and great grip Shoe fits perfectly. I have dropout and can walk better with the shoe. Everything great so far.	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Elevate-Trail-Running-Shoes/dp/B073S74T6M?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B079FBTC67&psc=1

Long story short- these are great. I was worried this D width wouldn't be wide enough- but what a surprise. And better than then 4E in the NB! So go figure. The cushioning of the sole is fabulous. I'm a fan- and I didn't expect to be. I was highly pleased with its performance. Even though the shoes are the same size 10, the black shoe seemed a better fit than the grey one I bought in the store. This is the third Hoka shoe I have worn and am very pleased with the fit and performance. If you don't mind the Herman Munster look, then by all means go ahead and purchase the most comfortable sneakers on Earth, but if you're single, buy some Bell Bottoms to cover them up. Just did a marathon with them, great cushioning and no blisters. This brand does not eliminate all the pain, but they do help. On my second run with the Hoka One One Bondi 6, I thought to myself -- with some humor -- that it felt like I was running in platform high heels. I also felt unstable in them, though I acknowledge the great reviews the shoes are getting, so I may be a chorus of one. In sum, I think they're well made with great cushioning, but the shoes are not for me. Great damping of the running hits. I like this product because it very comfortable and I have arthritis in my feet. Great shoe excellent support and comfort	https://www.amazon.com/HOKA-ONE-Mens-Bondi-Running/dp/B0788VBNJD?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07FYTPFN7&psc=1

I have had some plantar fasciitis on several occasions, and am very picky about comfort and support. I'm not a fast runner so I don't mind a tad more weight (these are fairly light, but I like Brooks Glycerins too), but for the price I couldn't turn down the opportunity to try the ASICS fuzeX. These fit essentially like my Noosas fit, but feel slightly narrower (relacing solved the problem). They are a bit stiffer than most ASICS are, but I find them very comfortable and supportive overall. I love the seamless construction and they are very breathable, which are two qualities I prize. Like many other ASICS products they come in a variety of colors, ranging from sedate to outlandish. I bought the most outlandish of the schemes (Black/Vermilion/White), which also happened to be the cheapest. (Coincidence?) These aren't my favorite running shoes, but I really do like them: for the price they are an unbeatable value. I have been looking to replace my reebok running shoes almost 2 months, and after long research I have decided to buy asics fuzex and I am very satisfied. Excellent running shoes worth every penny . It fits my foot very well and already ran 2 times 4 miles each and it was most enjoyable runs. The good - they look really cool. These were the ones that were the most expensive and should have been the best. Definitely great looking, but not great fitting. Fantastic shoes...meets the expectations. I have nimbus17 also and they are divine to run on the road. Whilst these are also far far better than the competition but these run a little stiff and tge interior lining is not luxurious as the nimbus or the kayanos. At this pricepoint it is really really good shoes and i paid 42.5$ for the pair.. They may look funky, but GOD...are they COMFORTABLE! Used them in the gym this morning and I don't remember having a more comfortable shoe while working out. They fit BETTER than a glove. This was one of the few runners listed as being helpful for runners who supinate (feet roll outward). The shoes are immediately comfortable out of the box offering a great blend of mild support and ample cushioning. The look of this shoe is great. The color combination is vibrant. I love looking at them. My first run in these--a speed workout--felt good. I've got a feeling these will be one of my most favorite runners. I love asics shoes, and have worn them for quite some time. I have never had that problem before, so I am hoping it goes away soon. It's been a couple months, and it doesn't seem to be getting better	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-fuzeX-Running-Shoe/dp/B00YB1JA0A?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B011EJF56Y&psc=1

Because it was one of my nicer running shoes I didnt run in them that much. I love the All Out Zooms I have 3 pairs (different colors) They showed up on time fit beautifully like a glove on my feet. The all white color is exactly what I was looking for they complete a very clean look. Lol so I just phase them out before that point and use my old ones for around the yard or doing chores. Overall, great shoes, especially for a person with back or knee problems. Hopefully they will bring fly net back in 2019. I bought the blue version of this shoe a year ago and love both the look and feel of this light and very comfortable shoe. I especially like the color coordinated bottom of the shoe instead of the usual white. Thank you Amazon!. Best Shoe I ever had. Pros: Great cushion, very comfortable for long walks/run & quite stable/sturdy. Cons : Very pricy @ 194$ My husband says these are his favorite sneakers.

130	10	Adidas Questar TND	['Textile and Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Imported', 'adidas']	"I also own the grey ones in Size 9. They run a little bigger, so with this pair I got 8.5 and they fit perfectly. I recommend getting a half size smaller than your usual size. These shoes have nice plush cushion to them for running which is why I chose them over the Questar BYD even though I wear them mostly for leisure. They are also nice and breathable. I especially love the style and look of these shoes. I find them to be a great value with excellent comfort and sweet looks. Being someone with Chronic Neuropathy in both feet, I go thru numerous shoes trying to find one with good padding (like walking on foam).Well these are very comfortable and feel great!!. They are worth a try, plus as you can see in my picture,I tie them underneathe the tongue giving that Adidas Logo all the attention instead of shoe strings laying over it. Im getting alot of where did you get those at from friends. Fits great, soo comfortable too, but like another reviewer mentioned a tad on the big side. I wear Nike, Puma, DC, Vans, New Balance, K-Swiss, Reebok and Asics in 11.5 and they all are perfect. I have to take off a star as it does feel like a size 12. I love the color and look of this shoe My husband needed new summer sneakers for work. He actually did buy a pair that he liked...but it turned out he liked them too much and doesn't want to ruin them them by wearing them for work. He really likes them, and says they're incredibly comfortable. The black soles of these sneakers are ideal for camouflaging how dirty they might get in the course of his work day. These are very comfortable shoes I Walk almost 5 to 7 miles a day. I am a lady that has a difficult time finding athletic shoes that fit comfortably (mainly in the heel), so I always go for men's shoes that seem to be cut higher in the back. I have had great experiences with Adidas being high quality and very comfortable and these are no exception. Love the simple colors, comfortable insoles, and durability. They are slightly bigger than I anticipated, but still fit great. I would recommend these for sure. Great pair of shoes, and the color is a nice red. NOTE: I read a couple posts, and one stated, "" I'm usually a size 9 (US) and I purchased one size down, 8.5 (US) and it fit perfect."" I'm also the same size as the person that commented. So i purchased the 8.5 and they were the perfect fit for someone who usually wears 9 (US). These shoes look nice and provide good cushion but have a different fit than other Adidas shoes I've owned. I still kept them and use them for workouts at the gym or casual wearing. If I was using them for distance running, I would return as there is enough play in the fit that I think they would potentially be uncomfortable. If you want to use them for running, recommend ordering a size down."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Questar-Running-Shoe/dp/B071VRZ795?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071F8145L&psc=1

The gel heel is one of the only good things. It's like having a vise grip squeezing both sides. It's too bad, if this fit like the pre-2015 Asics, then I would love this model. Hands down the most comfortable pair of running shoes Ive encountered. Great cushioning from heal to toe that mitigates a hard impact I have when running. Asics are comfortable, made well. They do run on the small side....Son wears 11.5 and knowing how this I bought a 12 and they fit well. These shoes fit perfect. The toe box is comfortable. Great shoe. Probably the most comfortable sneaker Ive ever worn. Fit as expected. Great foot support. Comfortable, Elegant, Good for all occasions. Well designed.

Sole has enough cushion also good road feel. Sole has enough cushion also good road feelLightweight. I tried a few other brands - all were 'okay', but this New Balance 1400v6 fits very well, has just the right amount of 'shoe' and weight for an old guy racing. I was looking for something slightly more than a racing flat and this 1400v6 fits the bill nicely. My first 10k is right around the corner and expect them to work very well. Note: as with most running shoes now days, the insoles are pretty basic. I swapped them out with a lightweight custom insole and now have a custom racer. first the Seller; everything was as I was expected, the delivery dates where perfect for me; thanks for taking care of that. About the running shoes, I have to Highlight the awesome light weight, and the free movement feeling, what I think it will improve my timing, very pleased; those will be tested on a couple of day with a light run of 10K, I will let you know.. Ok so first of all this is my second pair of NB1400. I loved everything about the shoe. The cushioning is great, just enough and overall weight is very acceptable . I would recommend this shoe for running up to 10k. Since I wear a 2E-wide shoe, I always have a tough time finding shoes that not only look good but also fit right. Positive:
Size/Fit. The 2E shoe fit my foot perfect. It's not too tight nor too loose. This is clearly solve be being super attentive and careful, but it's the one and only problem I've had so far. Ultralight and supportive around the midsole area. If I was an efficient long distance runner, I would wear these for the half/full marathons. Good cushioning. Good fit. The marathon is next week, and I'm pretty sure I'm going to love these. These are one of my favorite running shoes. Theyre light, responsive, and firm but not overly harsh."	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Mens-1400v6-Running/dp/B0791XWYCL?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07Q9KHJ8M&psc=1

They fit great and feel light as a feather. I was a little worried how theyd hold up on the 21 miler, but my feet felt great, none of that sore, throbbing feel you can get on those runs. I bought these shoes for a lightweight shoe I can wear to race marathons and half marathons, and up temp longer runs and I found a winner. I had 3 Clayton Ones, and I liked them. For me, the Mach's sole is a tad harder than that of the Clayton, the upper mesh is a tad thicker and hence a tad warmer. It is also a tad less flexible, but it doesn't hurt me (I run using socks). Overall the shoe is comfortable, it does not (yet?) give me blisters, it feels pleasant on the foot and pleasant to run, albeit a tad less soft than the Clayton. As for durability, my shoes soles usually look pretty good after 2000 miles, I could never understand people complaining about soles, I think they need to work on their running style. The Claytons were definitely far on the durable side in that aspect, as compared to some other modern day shoes. These are good shoes, just not a comfortable as my Clifton's. There is not as much cushioning but they are still good. Love these. Theyre great for my narrow feet as I can lace them tight as I want. The shoes are very light and breath well. These are fantastic. I put between 20 to 30 miles a week on them and they are holding up very well. Great shoe with lots of cushioning. Light very comfortable.

This new version, 13, does not disappoint. Build and sole is a lot like the 12. I'm on the backside of the 30 mountain and heading off into the sunset and I needs me my comfort and these shoes are it. Lots of cushion, good fit fore and aft. I do about 5 miles a day walking and jogging and the vomero is perfect for my antiquated joints. From the moment I put them on my feet thought they were in heaven. The fit was perfect both in length and width. The lacing system is fabulous because it molds the shoe to give an almost custom fit. I am so satisfied with the shoe I bought two more pair, just in case!. He loves them. As a master runner returning to running after a long lay off, he was looking for a comfortable, cushiony shoe with support. He tells me how great his feet feel all of the time. Plus, he likes the colors. Very comfortable to run in. I've been running in Nike Lunarglide 8's for a couple of years and these have a similar comfort level. I feel like they are a little more stable and while very comfortable the soles aren't quite as soft and won't pick up rocks like the Lunarglide 8's did. heaven! better than last four models, best yet imo My husband is a runner. The padding and support really help his knees and legs. Definitely worth the cost!. He loves them. He tried them on at the Nike store and saw that they were cheaper on Amazon by $40. They're super comfy for him. Though he still wear insoles on top of the ones it comes with.

UPPER: Quick-Dry Air Mesh.', '', '']	I am split on how I feel about these shoes, am a first time user of Altra and was very excited to try them, based on all the reviews and endorsements. I have been a runner for over 30 years and I heave never seen wear on any of my shoes like this. Kind of makes u want to ask, did they even test their product for durability? while also question the rest of their product line The Torin 2.0 was my favorite Altra shoe for distance running. The 3.0 is even better than the 2.0. I immediately fell in love with the 3.0 when I put them on. Fit is the same as the 2.0 Fit: As with the Torin 2.0 and the Torin 2.5, I love these shoes. I've had three surgeries (soon to be four) on my feet (MTP and TMT joints) and these are the best fitting shoes ~ the roomy toe box and zero drop sole are a slice of heaven for my battered feet. This keeps my heel secure, without over-tightening the laces in the toe box or mid-foot region. The Torin 2.5 run a half size too small, and the Altra customer support assisted me with selecting the correct corresponding size in mens shoe. An added bonus is the mens color schemes are relatively neutral compared to the vivid colors of the womens shoes. I highly recommend these shoes!. They take a little getting use to because of the zero drop and the thick cushion but I am happy with them. I wear a 11 1/2 - 12 W in dress shoes but in these I wear a 13 D. I am happy to sacrifice style for comfort. I loved the first pair so much I had to buy another color. I love Altra products for comfort and zero drop, but have mixed feelings over the years about sizing... it has been all over the place depending on what shoe you may be purchasing. Jumping up to a US 12 solved that issue. Same for the Torin 3.0, a US 12 fits nicely. For my casual uses, mostly walking and being on my feet much of the day, the Altra Torin(s) are cushy and comfortable. Construction is very good and I have not seen any fraying or other issues. If you are looking for a comfortable shoe for running or walking this is the one. Yup, that's exactly what it felt like. If you don't sweat very much, if you're not one of us 'crazy triathletes', or you are using these for off season treadmill workouts then you will be pleased with all of the awesomeness that you have come to expect from Altra (which is why I gave them three stars) Otherwise, keep looking. The sizing has been a little inconsistent and sometimes they try to save money by having the shortest tongue possible to the point of being uncomfortable. I usually get EEE shoes or wider and these are the best shoes I have found for accommodating my wide feet. I really liked the toe box. Liked the shoe.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N5HX5K4/ref=asc_df_B01N5HX5K41555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01N5HX5K4&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Issued Salomon GTX and Pro Mid while on active duty. This shoe is 100 times more comfortable out of the box. Light as hell but built like a tank. Great freaking shoes. They worked perfectly at the run. Ultra comfortable.. perfect grip for walls n what not. Love these. The boost soles make these so comfortable. Gortex keeps feet warm and dry. Haven't had a chance to get them out on the trail yet, but having owned several pair of Terrex GTX shoes, and boost shoes the combination of the two is awesome. I just feel more secure with regular laces (i just cut them out and replace with nylon sport laces - simple). Having tried them on I can already tell the boost definitely adds some welcome cushion in the sole over my previous Terrex GTX shoes. Most hiking shoes emphasize rigidity and support, which can be taxing when doing rock scrambling and dropping down from ledges. The sole is the same awesome Continental tire rubber from my previous pair - which has proven very effective even on the slickest of surfaces - well worn, wet rock faces. BTW these are perfect in many other situations (cold damp soccer fields, late-night star parties). Overall, extremely happy with the purchase. The quality and uniqueness of Goretex, Boost, and Continental definitely add to the price, but if you enjoy hiking and rock scrambling - you'll quickly see the ROI. A little bit stiff, need break in. Comfortable, waterproof, great outdoor shoe /trail shoe. Very happy with purchase. Great shoes. So comfortable I walk in them all day long.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-outdoor-Mens-Terrex-Skychaser/dp/B071GWHQPT?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B010RFXB58&psc=1
143	23	Adidas Supernova Glide Boost 8	['Synthetic-and-mesh']	"I can say definitively that the adidas Super Nova Glide 8 are the very best I have ever worn. They are a masterful combination of cushioning comfort, perfect fit and just the right amount of motion control. Their Boost technology is a break thru which retains its cushioning properties over long periods of time. I can recommend these without qualification. Absolutely fantastic. Great running shoe. It's a shame it's replaced by a caricature version of this shoe now in the new Supernova M - will be milking all the miles I can out of these and my older Glide 7's before having to go to other Running Shoe companies since these will no longer be available.
- The blend of support, cushioning, stability and comfort is perfect.
- Works well both on medium runs and longer 10+ mile runs.
- Not sure why Adidas would discontinue these with the huge faithful following and great reviews year after year.
- Good to alternate with another shoe and balance out slightly more and slightly less cushion to minimize injury risk and extend life of the shoe. I really, really liked these shoes but unfortunately they are useless even though they are in otherwise great condition. Costly purchase..will have to stick with my saucony triumphs. Note: the sticky part surrounding the hole in the picture is from a failed attempt to use adhesive moleskin to fix the problem A few weeks ago, I was looking to purchase a new pair of beaters because my Roshes were getting pretty nasty, and these seemed to fit the bill pretty well: the price point was similar, they looked pretty nice, and they featured some adidas boost. The boost in the midsole makes these a pretty soft ride when I'm just standing about or wandering around, but one morning I was late and had to sprint to the bus - that's when these shoes really showed their colors. Since these shoes don't have a complete boost midsole I can only imagine what that would be like. In any case, I would recommend these shoes for anyone looking for a comfortable, athletic-style shoe for casual usage with some running here and there. Most comfortable running shoes I've ever experienced. I've always experienced shin pain and other aches when running even intermediate distances but these have allowed me to increase my mileage, even on knees with osteoarthritic issues. Continental rubber soles wore down a little faster than I'd expect at 150-200 miles, but I weigh 195 and have run them pretty hard. I've literally set up an alert for when they are offered below $110, lol. NOTE:
If you're looking for alternatives to the Supernova Glide 8, I've had good experiences with Newton Gravity iii's (Size 11D for me) for my shin and knee pain; I can find them more regularly on Amazon than the Adidas Supernovas, usually around $85. I've put around 300 miles on these and they are the best daily trainer I've ever used. The outer sole is holding up great even though Adidas changed to a softer continental rubber. The earlier continental rubber was nearly indestructible, but I still expect around 500 miles in these before they are done. It's simply an amazing shoe that does everything just right. I love Adidas. They just fit my foot perfectly well. Bought these for my runs, which range from 3-5 mi usually 3-4 times a week when I'm in running mode -- not a long distance runner, that's as much as I care to do. Comfort is great, unlike other shoes I don't have the odd pressure points (again, my personal fit with Adidas, your mileage may vary). Toe box feels good, which is nice as shoes tend to squish in my toes I feel like. I tend to run on balls of my feet, felt great both then or later when I tire and start to shift closer to mid-foot or even heel striking. The cushioning took some time to get used to, it's feels ""squishier"" than any shoe I've ran in and for awhile it felt a little bit like I had constantly stepped in something. However now that I'm used to it, it's great and it's probably great for my knees. I think these have definitely helped reduced that."	https://www.amazon.com/Adidas-Performance-Supernova-Glide-Running/dp/B0115Q2LJ0?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01E0MX9ZG&psc=1

I have tried asics gel venture, nike revolution 3 and nike fs lite run 3 and so far these gel kayanos are the only pair of shoes wherein i haven't felt pain on my feet. Instead, i would describe the feeling as similar to running on a thick foam tile like the ones with the letters of the alphabet used in toddlers' rooms. Also, i would admit that this is my first time getting shoes online so i was half expecting to return it as soon as i try it on but it fits perfectly. I have always been a size 12 4e, at least with all my previous shoes and i read somewhere here that it may be smaller but i would have to say it fits perfectly. Lastly, it looks really cool. It's one of those things that you would be proud to show off to the other guys running at the neighborhood trail. Over all, this has to be one of the best running shoes around. I would say it's the best but i haven't really tried them all but i'm confident enough to say that it's worth writing this long review for. Overall, I AM ONE HUNDRED PERCENT SATISFIED and if you are looking for a great pair of shoes for running, this has to be it. Read more These are fantastic. I'm a big guy, about 6'4"" 225lbs and these are perfect. A big heel to help distribute my weight evenly as I lumber on the treadmill. For some reason I feel like ASIC only gets every other model right. If you're on the heavy side or kinda stomp when you run, these are amazing. Great fit and very, very comfortable. On the other hand I've been buying Asics for over 30 years so I do have some experience behind my comments. First, these are very comfortable shoes. They feel like plush bedroom slippers when you put them on. But that's about it for good news. I don't ever remember getting this slap from my other ASICs. In fact my new favorite ASICS is the J33. I've bought two of them over the past two years and even though advertised as a 'racing' shoe, I have run many training miles on my first pair without any discomfort whatsoever. The following was written a month after I wrote the above: I've had them for 120 miles now and like them better than I thought I would. I wear earphones so I don't hear the slap I get, but they are really comfortable. I don't think I will race in them, but they are an excellent training shoe if you don't drag your feet. The inner heel holes are not just a cosmetic annoyance, either. I'm trying to get some more life out of the shoes by using sticky heel protectors now, but this is not a problem I should have had after only a month of wear. I've never had running shoes wear out like this."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-GEL-Kayano-Running-Shoe/dp/B00XZWAQ22?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00PY064RE&psc=1

I've worn Asics for years but never put much thought into it other than whether they felt good. My last pair were the Asics Gel Kayano 18 which have worked well despite being more of a shoe for overpronaters. Normally, at least my Asics, have always run true to size but that was not the case here. I bumped both up to a size 11 which worked much better. My feet are probably on the larger size of normal and I fit but any wider and I think I would have had to keep looking. Both would probably have satisfied my needs but in the end the Dynaflyte prevailed. The combination of cushion and weight (as in being light) was really great and surprising. If there is one critique I have is that it would be nice to have more color options. The three available colors today are certainly an acquired taste but no stars marked off from me since I actually really like the grey version that I purchased. Finally, as I write this it is day 1 of me wearing them for the entire day and I have no issue with comfort. My feet feel as good as when I put them on 9 hours ago. I'm very happy with my purchase and recommend them. Read more Great offering from ASICS. Pros: super light, well constructed design, solid midfoot support, heel hold, impressive cushioning given the weight. Fit is great for a bit of a wider foot - not so wide as to require wide fit 2E shoes, but on the wider side of normal. Typically wear NB's due to width fit and found these great. Great trainer. It's noticeably warmer than other shoes say the Nike air Pegasus but not enough to not to run with the shoe. I ordered anyway and don't have any regrets. Great shoes. This is my first pair of ASICS. I don't know what the return policy is or what it can be done to reduce that feeling. Thank you,
Mario A. Exceptional service. Great sneakers. They are true to size and very comfortable. The best thing is I only have to tie them once then I can slip my foot right in it without tieing it again.

I've been waiting to write a review until I've had a chance to thoroughly test them. However, I also hiked some VERY rugged terrain on the closed off, rain washed route to the top of Cerro Chato volcano in Costa Rica. Where my friends are slipping and sliding, these shoes ensure a firm grip on most any surface. Each yellow fixture on the bottom is a lug of well designed hard sticky rubber and the sole of the shoe is a rock hard plate designed to prevent your feet from bruising on any sharp objects you might step on. The only downside is the heel section can be rough on your feet. make sure to wear a evenly thick sock. I LOVE these shoes. Lightest weight with best traction (both up and down hill). Bought a pair a year ago and backpacked (with 35lbs) the John Muir Trail - 250 miles and over 50,000' of elevation gains and an additional 50,000' of descents - never slipped once. I really like these, but fitment is smaller than any shoe I've owned. I traded up twice with these to finally get a pair that fit. I thought 11.5 would fit, but finally ended up with a size 12. I wasn't sure I liked them that much based on pics, but they are much nicer in person. I ended up getting a second pair due to the great price. Quality construction, and great overall shoe. Just make sure to order 1 size larger than usual. There is plenty of room for those socks and in the toe, as well. The soles are really sticky and have excellent traction, even on moss-covered rocks in the tidepools. Plenty of arch support in the insole. The mesh uppers feel as comfortable as a big sock on your foot. These are great shoes, and very nice-looking, too. I love La Sportiva products. They are my favorite pair of shoes in my closet. They are comfortable and lightweight, yet very sturdy and supportive. They drain well and perform on hikes when they get submerged in streams. And, as you would expect from a rockclimbing company, the traction is EXCELLENT. These things maintain solid grip even when my friends are slipping and sliding all over themselves. The Bushidos are a great investment. I would buy them again and again. i have bad feet (neuropathy) so shoe choice and fit is crucial. i've tried every mass brand sold in my corner of America. the only ones that came close were some Asics and one or two New Balance. both pale in comparison to this stronger, lighter, more stable, and grippier rain, snow, pavement, mud, dirt, gravel, and sand shoe.
if you're looking for the best dog walking shoe? here it is. the best trail runner under $100 - right here thank you very much. even if you just go to the gym in them, you'll appreciate the stability.

the best thing is i can feel like a *normal"" person and stand for more than a few minutes with these shoes. I run/walk about 15 miles a week, trail and road and I need a sturdy shoes with a lot of support and this shoe seems to fit the bill. I have wide feet and do feel a bit of pinching on my big toe but I hope this goes away as I break these in.

This fits just like the 2000-4. I have run in the ASICS GT model for over 25 years, ordering by mail order (Road Runner Sport).

I thought that adidas could never top their SuperNova Glide 8 since it was such a great product. Well, to my amazement they did exactly with the newly chrisened Supernova (sans ""Glide"" moniker). The cushioning on the SuperNova is the best I have experienced in over 30 years of running. Like running on pillows, but not mushy at all. Really nice energy return. The toe box comfort level is very high. It's perhaps a little wider than the usual adidas structure, but still provides more than adequate support and ""give"" as needed. In addition, the Boost material is compressing and not returning to its original level. Between the out sole wearing at the heel and the compression of the heel cushioning, it feels like I'm walking/running up hill. I also like the way it looks - - with the classic 3 stripes of course and also tasteful and not overstated colors. Read more Wide toebox, low arch, plenty of lovely Boost cushion, it feels like nothing bad could happen to your feet in this shoe. A great recovery, training or long run shoe. The Adidas Boost sneaker came through surprisingly well on both fronts. He told me Adidas Boost is the best sneaker you can buy. Now, this particular Supernova model is low on the Boost end. It costs a fraction of what the better Boost sneakers cost. However, this is my first entry into Adidas Boost and I must say, I am really impressed. I topped it off with red Xpand laces, which I highly recommend (look them up on Amazon). These seem to be so comfortable and cushioned that they will probably make me a better runner. I feel as if I will be a BOOST buyer for years to come. These really set the bar as being extremely comfortable footwear. Read more I like this shoe. When I say it fit as expected I know that adidas tend to run narrow. It is definitely softer in the heel than last year's version. I like that it fits snug from the heel to the stripes and then is open. I have felt some lacing pressure on the top of my foot, nothing totally uncomfortable but as a caveat: I have a tall foot, and I think the plastic panel with the stripes on it does give over the course of the run. I have not had it on a run for longer than 5 miles yet, so I can't comment on the comfort on long runs. It's not the airyest shoe I've had but it hasn't been uncomfortable. The toe bumper is shallower than last year but the plastic used is softer/more flexible so you don't really notice it. The ride feels very neutral, no real lean in or out.(Seems like even neutral shoes now want to make you lean out.) it's a good shoe I run between 25 - 30 miles a week, and am in the minority of runners who underpronate. However, in researching recommended shoes for underpronation, these adias Supernovas were very well reviewed. They are fantastic. As I was finishing my first run in them, I was thinking ""Where have these been all my life?"" Very comfortable. The heel design works perfectly with my stride. But for me, they work really great."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Supernova-Running-Shoe/dp/B01H663JJ4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MRZP4SJ&psc=1

157	7	Saucony Excursion TR 12	['Fabric or Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'GRID cushioning system', 'Durable rubber outsole', 'Trail specific mesh', 'Closure type is Lace-Up']	They fit and felt great immediately and that is very rare for me. Also they looked really good for a running shoe. IMO the best looking ones were the 7 and 8 and I hope they return to something similar and with the Orange/Black some day. I then grabbed a pair of Suacony running shoes (not sure what kind they were) and they instantly felt perfect and I picked those up. It's rare I find shoes that feel good especially right away. They felt great at first but also needed the usual break in. A couple weeks later I decided to purchased a pair of TR12s on Amazon and put the TR9's back in the closet (for the future). I swapped over and the TR12s felt perfect immediately. I don't know what it is but they felt like they needed zero break in or adjustment even compared to the TR9's I had just put on. Comfortable. Very nice looking (for a running shoe). Newer versions last well. Also careful on wet polished floors. They slip like crazy, as I assume other shoes like this do. Hard to buy older versions and some of them look better to me. I highly recommend trying Saucony TR line of shoes. Read more First off, these are extremely comfortable shoes. The Saucony is a great shoe for flat trails or road running. They fit perfectly but the back of the shoe doesn't cradle your heel and it flexes easily allowing your heel to slide when stepping on rocks or steep trails. I'm keeping them because they are great for running the neighborhood but if you want them for trails or hiking, DO NOT get these. I walk 10 plus miles a day at work and so far these are the best footwear I'm worn in a very long time. This is my third pair and while I don't expect to get more that a few months out of each pair; that's fine for now. They fit well an you can feel how the comfort all day long. For the price point this is your best bet. Usually wear 10.5-11 and 11 in these fits me well. Used them to do the Grand Canyon r2r2r and then bought another pair to do my first marathon in. Used to just wear shoes until they fell apart but have realized recently how much better my feet and knees feel when I replace shoes more often. These work well for me and dont break the bank. The footbed is comfortable and needs minimal breaking in (it took maybe a day to get the optimal feel). The tread is aggressive enough for trail running as well as a jogging, but also well designed for walking around town. It's nice to have a good looking shoe that preforms as needed. Kudos Saucony. I have owned several previous versions of the Saucony Excursion TR series, and they have all performed well. They are light weight, and comfortable. The fit from shoe to shoe is always consistent. This model looks cool, is really comfortable, and has a sole that I need for hiking the mountains & hills of California. Been buying the saucony running shoes off of amazon for awhile now and these are the first pair of cross trainer saucony that I have purchased. I will be buying these from now on because they are twice as comfortable as the cohesion.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Excursion-TR12-Sneaker/dp/B07FFWT1HP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077Y3WFFM&psc=1

Upon arrival, I inspected the quality and condition and they were perfect. I tried them on and like other reviews, they were a bit snug at first for a couple hours but after a day of wear they began to loosen up. They look great and feel great. If they last me a good while, I will definitely buy another pair in the future. 100% agree w/reviewer Bill - LOVED the Assert 6's - one of, if not the most comfortable running shoes I've ever worn... I also agree that the material used in the Assert 7 (vs. I hate it when companies try to ""improve"" products that are already great, and end up taking a step backwards - if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Order one size up than you usually wear I wear size 9 in Nike but reading reviews brought one size up 9.5 but still is tighter, hope it gets loosened after some days. Nice style though good for gym and work. A little stiffer than the usual Under Armour shoes I buy and I buy a lot, I wear them out in about 6 months with my line of work but I love these shoes... overall great so far, breaths well, comfortable (just stiff at first) and good if youre on your feet all day and have an active job / lifestyle . I don't feel that I've owned these shoes long enough to give an honest review but since I received the e-mail from Amazon I thought I would give my feedback so far. These are great shoes and since I am throwing out ALL of my Nike gear for political reasons and giving companies like Under Armour my full support I have purchased shoes for my entire family. These shoes are high quality and are true to size. I wear a size 10, ordered a size 10 and they fit perfectly. I also ordered shoes for the family and they all love them and feel that they are true to size as well. I highly recommend these shoes. However, I still ordered a half size up in the men's version and I am so glad I did. I would highly recommend purchasing a .5 size up in ANY Under Armour shoe if you don't have narrow feet. These shoes are absolutely wonderful. I LOVE them. I have ran in them already and completed a HITT workout and they performed top notch and my feet don't hurt. My favorite parts about these shoes are the color (black/rhino gray) and how grippy the soles are during my HITT workout. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone!!. I will be ordering another pair, because they are worth it. I've had two pairs of the Assert 6 and loved them, the 7 isn't an improvement. They also seem narrower than the 6 in my regular size, but that may improve over time. It's still a decent shoe, but the 6 was overall nicer and was a really good value. Seems like sometimes these model changes are mainly cost-cutting exercises. These shoes are very comfortable for the purchase price on Cyber Monday. They are just a smidge longer than I expected, but they are still extremely comfortable. Theres plenty of cushion and padding on the insole as well as on the sides any tongue of the inside of the shoe. Perfect for walking a dog, a light jog, or errands. (I have done all 3 since these came in the mail) I have yet to test these out on a long distance run (5k+)"	https://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Micro-Assert-Sneaker/dp/B077V42PFP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071VTRV5Z&psc=1

This company consistently makes good shoes. Have been recommended the Omni series for the last few years. I like this rendition, although I noticed a few issues. I'm managed to wear out the heels on the soles in a matter of 3 months, and I would say I'm a 10k runner at best. It seems like the heels are not as thick as they were on previous Omni shoes. This shoe is quite different from its predecessors, but so far I find it very comfortable. I haven't worn it on a long run yet, but hope it works out. I don't find it as stiff as previous versions...hoping that doesn't mean that it provides less support for an over-pronator. Overall build is great and the shoe improved.

I'm sorry to hear others aren't as into this shoe, but as a runner who does some distance (up to 13.1), I'm very happy with my purchase. These are true to regular Nike sizes. They fit like a glove. I think these shoes fit best without socks. Like walking on a cloud. It's been a few weeks now and shoes are still working out great. I would definitely recommend and am already planning on buying another pair. Great shoes. Fits well and is really comfortable. For over a year I thought I was suffering from joint pains and needed to do some other type of cardio like swimming, but glad I figured it out and just switched shoes. Don't get me wrong, I love the extra half inch of height it provides, but I find myself tripping every now and then. But besides that, great shoes. These are good shoes, but I call this version (Lunarglide 8s) my ""Pebble Catchers"" because the tread pattern picks up all these pebbles from my run and then deposits them in my house. Love the way these shoes look and feel. If it wasn't for that I would keep them because they are comfortable, light weight, and have quite a bit of cushion for stability. I also love the bright colors. My husband loves these. After a lot of research on this issue, an article recommended these specific shoes. Plus, the added bonus is he feels better wearing the Nike brand (that our sons wear) than some old man looking shoe no one has heard of. SEE PHOTO

If you need really good support, this is your shoe. These shoes are so good, I can wear them without my orthotics. Good luck. These shoes are very cushy, yet have some support. That may be a good thing in disguise, since many people run in shoes that have lost their cushion, just because the soles are still good. Second, they squeek at every step :( I love these shoes, the cushion is like nothing I've ever experienced, it's like walking on cloud lol, the fit is snug, and I have a very narrow fit, overall, they do run a bit small, my size is 9,5 and they were too small for me, I returned them and ordered a larger size. Oh, and they look very cool :) I previously bought a couple of pairs of the Hoka One One Gaviota shoes and was extremely happy with the cushioning. However, when I bought a new pair, I found the new Gaviota to be like strapping slabs of concrete to my feet - nothing like the original shoe. But the thickness in sole and cushion will allow the runner to recover from knee pounding. Highly recommended This is a good shoe.... Im a heavier guy working hard to get 80 lbs off and a good shoe is one of the most important parts to that success. Felt ok with stock padding insole, but once I put my orthodics inside they became extremely comfortable. Stable shoe. Ran today for first time in 2 years thanks to those shoes almost identical fit and ride to hoka constant 2, IF you order them a 1/2 size larger. Still worth checking out if you can catch them on sale. If they are supportive enough for you, you will enjoy the premium cush. Haven't tried the Arahi to compare, mainly because they have an EARLY stage meta rocker, which is more suitable for midfoot strikers, compared to the gaviotas (and constants), which feature a LATE stage meta rocker, definitely more suited to heel strikers like me.. I wear a size 10 in mens...that is what I ordered...and it fit as expected. This is my first pair of Hokas and they re amazing.

Like the NB, it's just these are more comfortable for my feet. Excellent buy . Fit was perfect . From day one , I was impressed with this shoe. The shoe was excellent in cushioning and shock absorb the pound on my knees . These are so much better than my others shoe brands . I was also surprised how light the shoe is . My husband is an avid runner and we go through shoes every 6 months as expected but not because the break .. we actually have never had this happen with any running shoes. I honestly don't know if Sauconys are getting more narrow, or if, as I age, my feet are spreading in the that area. I wear these shoes comfortably all day. I'd recommend this shoe as a walking shoe. That's the best use. This is my first pair of Sauconys and I must say that these running shoes are very comfortable and cushiony. I bought these shoes with the intent of an everyday walking shoe, but they are so comfortable and light that I tried them for running (I usually run 3-5 miles 3 to 4 times a week). They have a good ""feel"" on the road and are now my Go To running shoes. I would recommend these shoes to someone that wants to try a pair of Saucony running shoes. I have always loved Saucony running shoes, but didn't want to drop $150 for a pair of running shoes that may be reduced to "" casual walkers"" if the therapy recovery did not allow running. Very happy to say these fit great and provide exceptional comfort. I was leery about this light weight shoe providing support, but is very comfortable. Fantastic deal for $40. Thanks I usually wear Saucony Guide sneakers for running but needed these for rainy days. What I didnt realize was that these offer significantly less support than the Guide. Super nice in that aspect, but if you need a running shoe that your foot doesnt just melt and squash all around in- go with a different model than these."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07C2VDKCY/ref=asc_df_B07C2VDKCY1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B07C2VDKCY&linkCode=asn&psc=1
166	16	Hoka One One Arahi	['Synthetic']	"I did not find that to be true. This fit quite well right out of the box. The first impression was that I liked the fitment, the color was bright, and the sole felt much different than all shoes I've worn before. After running my first day in them I found them to fit snugly. They are tight to the foot over the top and the laces have a lot of elasticity to them which keeps them tight to the foot. However, after running in them for almost 2weeks, I can say that the soles of the shoe do get quite hot while running in warmer temperatures. Walking in them feels different due to the sole, but running in them is a rather natural feeling. Overall, I like them. Read more We love Hokas for their comfort, but they tear apart easier than other shoes at this price point. Unfortunately, they are the only shoes that we have found in years that provide perfect relieve to a problem with Chronic Plantar Fascitiis, so we will be buying more. However, if we ever find another brand that relieves this problem we will leave Hoka in hopes of finding something that does not tear apart in 3-4 months. Hoka One One, please make more of your shoes in the WIDE! I have always been a huge fan of the Hoka lineup, but they have a very limited selection of EE shoes in their arsenal. That will be amazing when/if it happens. The Clifton is a fantastic shoe, but it's just too narrow for me. I have been in Asics Nimbus, Adidas Boost, Altra, and many other brands. Take it form a Navy Vet that spent some time in ""Special Programs."" My joints have taken a beating, from many years playing football, being a formal Federal Investigator where fitness standards are high, and my days in the Navy. These shoes will save your knees, back, neck, etc. The Arahi is very stable, plenty responsive, good rocker strike, and plush like no other shoe. Yet another great shoe from Hoka. I usually get Asics which have always been great for me but a friend talked me into this brand because of the science behind it. They were comfortable when I first put on and walk in them although the way the shoes are designed changes my gait slightly. They are also light on my feet and good for running in that regard. I run 6 miles and the arch support placed blisters on both of my feet. Read more I wear a 9.5 in Women's shoes and often go up a half size because I have wide feet so I often buy men's athletic shoes for the extra width and that is definitely necessary in Hoka's since they tend to run so narrow. This shoe is available in wide widths but I tried the 8.5 medium width in mens that had worked for me in the Challenger ATR. This show seems a little narrower out of the box but having worm it a few times it is loosening up so I'm thinking that like the Challenger it will stretch with use. I pronate and usually deal with this by putting arch support insoles in neutral shoes rather than buying stability shoes so I was pleasantly surprised that the support is actually perfectly where I need it. I'm not a runner but these work great for walking and long periods of standing. Read more The Hoka One One is the best walking and running shoe I've had so far. This shoe serves me well.

Length-wise I ordered a 13 US and it seems true to size, width-wise they were a bit narrower than I expected, and I began to get hot spots on my left forefoot at about mile 5 on the very first run. After that the little bit extra room was good, and the last run in them of 11.5 miles with lots of up and down went well. My next step will be to remove the laces and put regular running shoe laces in so I can heel lock them a bit better for less toe banging downhill. Overall I am happy despite having to make my own modifications to them. These shoes are cushy enough and protective enough that I don't notice the missing insoles, even with thin Darn Tough socks. My first test was 11 kms at 11am temp 32c until 1pm, good sensations, not narrow (worry about toe box), not blisters, not black nails (used to happen me in long distances), Cushing ok (terrain its a lil bit rocky), hot day and dry I just felt lil hot shoes for a while but not to worry, tie shoe lances perfect. 2nd test was longer than, 36 kms, not blister, not black nails, Cushing: would like a lil bit more in front- middle zone(after this I inserted a gel insoles for Cushing improvement), grip was perfect, never felt loose control or swiped. Amazing fit for my feet, and held well in 1""-1 1/2"" mud. I was surprised by the grip. I think that this particular shoe will be very good for runners with a wider foot and at around 200lb (despite body fat percentage).

2. The 2 ""pillows"" inside the shoe in each side of the inside of the upper above the heel that hug the foot seem to make the heel more locked.
3. The shoe is far better looking than Kinvara 9. The gunmetal shade version is nice looking and definitely the most stylish. Coming from a more minimalist shoe, i really wish these would be lighter, a tiny bit narrower, and with lower stack height.
2. For some reason the Kinvara 10 is a slightly longer shoe than Kinvara 9 and this does not seem to add benefit because when i tried Kinvara 9 i don't remember i had issues with the length of it. The gunmetal gray version is the only non ""clownish"" color that i can proudly wear outside of a sport activity environment. I could swallow the idea of wearing the blue version as well, though the rest of the color options are way too ""screamy"" for a day to day shoe outside of a sport event. Make the shoe lighter (try to hit 200g or less for size 9US), a tiny bit narrower (or leave the width as is but definitely do not make the width wider), and with a lower stack height.
2. Shorten the length of the shoe to Kinvara 9's length while maintaining the ""true to size"" fit.
4. Offer more non ""clownish"" colors than only a gunmetal shade option for people who wear these for casual wear. Read more Read the online reviews for many good descriptions.

First, they breathe a lot better, which at this time of year (Summer) makes a huge difference on long runs. With the Zante v2, you get a comfortable ride and support in a shoe that goes like lightning. The Vazee Rush v2 does the same, but even better. As far as appearance goes, these shoes are absolutely gorgeous in person and are extremely well constructed. I couldnt decide between the black/salmon color and the grey with high-lite, so I ordered both and am extremely happy I did. In short, if youre looking to go really fast in a shoe that feels incredibly light but provides a great ride, support, ventilation and looks, order these shoes. You will not be disappointed. The shoe is fun. It's really bouncy and surprisingly resilient. It doesn't handle turns the way my Kinvaras do, but on straight stretches, it just rolls. I am loving how cool my feet stay. They breath very well, and dried quickly after running in the rain. My last NB fresh foams lasted past 800 mi, so we'll see if I can get the same longevity from these. They're great. After a few trial runs on the treadmill, I took them outside, and I love them. Just the right amount of cushioning, and the way they suit my mid-foot landing pattern perfectly. Also, they are extremely porous, which should suit me well as we get into the warmer months. Read more These shoes look amazing, there very nice and squishy on the heels, the tread looks like it will hold up for a little bit. I wear size 9 and they are perfect fit. This also came surprising to me that they came perfectly laced up ready to rock. Not sure if this was seller or I got lucky but it was a pristine lace job. OMG! EXACT SAME FIT and FORM - for LESS. I bought two more pairs in the event the men's become impossible to find. This is a fantastic shoe for runners with huh arches and a touch bit of the ole plantar fasciitis in the heels. I'm crushed that New Balance decided to sunset the Vazee Rush. ?
Read more I probably should have gone up a half size, but they still fit without any discomfort and fit with my orthotics (a bit tight) as well. Like with most athletic shoes, the cushioning feels the best the first week of wear. I wear them almost every morning for about 90 minutes of walking and after five months the soles have not worn down as much as previous shoes from other makers; the inside back of the heel has held up  almost every other previous shoe wore out, through the foam and down to the heel cup after only a couple of months. I got the Protect Pack black and silver; the glow in the dark isnt going to be for everyone since the greenish tint midsole can glow even in dim lighting. Read more LOVE EM!

Running about 30-35 miles a week with these guys and have no complaints. The tread at this point, seems to be holding up rather well ( just came off of the New Balance Fresh Foam Zante V2 and it seems like the tread is a little more robust )

The breath-ability is great. Running at night has gotten a little more fun.

Anyway, I'm using the Mizuno Wave Inspire 14 size 10 2E Silver/Directoire Blue as a basis of comparison to review this new model. Long story short, I ordered the Wave Inspire 15 in size 10 2E (Wide) Black/Dark Shadow hoping that the size would be the same as its predecessor. Don't get me wrong, if you get your sizing correct, these are one of the best shoes around its price (and even against models doubling its price). The support these shoes offer, specially if you need a lot of support on your heels, is amazing. Plus I love the sound of the heels hitting the floor when walking. For now, I just got some other brand running shoes while I wait to see what customer support can do to help me in this matter, and edit this review if I get to try a different size of the Wave Inspire 15. So I searched for the best stability sport shoe, which is this Mizuno. It is excellent. And when walking, the fatigue I feel in my lower back is much better, probably because I'm not fighting for balance all the time. I've been so happy with the Paradox shoes, but they've been discontinued. I'm giving myself about another month before my feet tear through the outer edges, or I roll my ankle.

I have battled a few injuries, and rest (along with come Cortisone shots) have done the trick when combined with good new shoes. My toes have always tended to wear little holes in the sides of the shoes, so I've gone to a 2E size and that has worked well. Sometimes it felt like the toe box was too big, but maybe my foot is just a little wierd. After going through 5 pairs of GT-2000 V4s, apparently Asics no longer has any of my size remaining, so I have to step up to something newer (rant: I wish they would just stick with one design for many years, but I won't get off on that tangent). I could not find any shoes online that fit that were under $120, so I decided to try out the GT-1000 series V6 which happens to be available for me (11.5 2E). I have used GT-1000s in the past with great success, but got hooked on the excellent GT-2000s. Sure enough, when compared next to my GT-2000 V4s, the bottom is virtually identical. The actual fit and function is excellent. Honestly it feels VERY similar to the GT-2000s, but maybe is an ounce or two lighter. There is a ""stability"" insert in heal so it still works well for me (I have some mild pronation issues). It cushions well and feels great. The upper part of the shoe feels like they shed some of the support that was built into the GT-2000s, but so far that has not bothered me (in fact I prefer the new feel; feels like I am almost just running in socks that have soles). The only question I have is whether these will hold up; I have had good luck overall with the brand, so I assume I will get 6 months or so of use from them (500+ miles). But if not you can be sure I will provide an update to my review. For the price, so far I think I have managed to still find great shoes for under $100.

Speaking only for the 4E, these are far more narrow than the version 5 I linked above. I would suspect the D and 2E will also run narrow, so I would recommend people with normal feet start with 2E or 4E and see if they need something more narrow. For people with bunions, look for something with a wider toe box or the version 5 GT-1000 which are basically the best shoes ever. I am very impressed with the design of the ankle padding. It closes around the ankle like trail running shoes, but is soft enough for everyday wear. So if you're interested in outdoor sports these might be a great option.

Read more Having been used to running in stable shoes like Brooks Adrenaline, I was a little leery to switch to anything less stable and with nearly zero drop in them. I have improved my gate considerably and no longer need stable shoes according to the run store that did a gate analysis. I don't mean to sound like a shoe snob, but after spending lots of money on running shoes, I found it hard to believe a shoe that was under $100 and could be found in an average sporting goods store and even some shoe stores would actually be a good shoe. Although they had a slightly heavier feel they certainly had more energy return and I really felt a spring in my step. The fact that they are more stable than the average trail shoe really helped on the technical parts of the trail. Springy Feel: 9.5/10
Comfort: 9/10
Stability for a trail shoe: 10/10
Stability for a road shoe: 8/10
Weighty feel on your feet: 6/10
Overall: 9/10

All and all if you are a road runner looking to get on the trails and needs a shoe that can handle both, I HIGHLY recommend the Asics Gel-Kahana 8

It's not Saucony's BEST design, but it's still a 4 star shoes from me, and I'm pretty picky about running shoes (as you might have guessed). I really like these running shoes, they fit like a glove which is what I have come to expect from Saucony, the laces don't slip so I don't have to double knot them, the heal lock is quite good, and I just don't have to think about what shoes I'm running in regardless of what I'm running on like pavement, trails, or gravel paths since they do the job well on all these surfaces. Hope you like them as much as I do. If I put the SuperFeet on top of the regular inserts, my feet still fit and that squeaking is gone so that's what I'm currently doing. I love the color/design of these. Overall, I'm pleased. I had the Breakthru 3 and liked it . This shoe improves the 3 by having a larger toe box. I love the look and feel of these. My only knock is that I wish it had just a tad more cushion for the front part of your foot. Great price great shoe and fast shipping. I run 510 miles a day and these have provided great support and comfort for my feet. I like them so much that I purchased 3 pair to make sure I have a great shoe to last the remainder of the year. I have plantar fasciitis and these are the only shoes I have found that are comfortable without any inserts. These shoes are perfect for a runner. Light weight, breathable, supportive in the right areas. I run 5-10 miles a day 5-6 days a week and I like these so much that Ive purchased 4 pair to get me through this next year since running is a big part of my life.

I decided to keep the 8.5s and removed the insoles to allow for more space inside the shoes. Thus the snug fit. Now, it takes one or two iterations to find the proper fit. In warm days, i have to wipe my hands with my t-shirt to remove the sweat from my fingers to have a good grip and be able to turn the knob. Now the soles are much more flexible and my heels keep in place durinag my rides. When they were new, i had to put a good amount of force to bend the shoes using my hands, now (after 50km) i can bend the shoes easily with my hands. Feeling: they are good for competition as they are light and responsive. Looks: i love them. vibrant neon colors mixed with black is a very appealing combo. The fit is pretty consistent and I've been wearing socks with them. Their medial support seems to be adequate and comparable to my Brooks Ravenna 8. So far, great shoe with minimal pressure point issues, because of the BOA system. Couple Hundred Mile Update:

I actually ordered another pair of these as a beater pair, so I can save my hilighter yellow ones for race day. These shoes are durable and I find them comfortable enough to wear on daily runs. I would definitely recommend these shoes for anyone looking for racing flats with support. I ran my best times using the mighty 727's. So good that when they brought out the 828 (basically a re-issued 727 but different color) I bought 10 pairs. But when they get it right they are the best. So far so good.

1. Don't get me wrong they are not heavy, but they are not what I would have expected as a ""racing shoe"". The fit is excellent. Not these, the curve just right and the bridge of the foot is accommodated for but not too loose. The heel to toe differential at 6° is also very nice.
3. The lacing system is great, I don't even tighten these I just tie a bow and off I go. The ""sock"" liner tongue is elasticated and creates the perfect fit for me.
4. The length fit is a little small, the weight is a tad high for a racer, but crucially - the sole is wearing very quickly right at the front where the sole wraps up onto the toe area. I have NEVER worn an out sole here before, but in another 50 or so miles (400 total) I will be through to the EVA. I will have to put a small patch of shoe goo on there. I like these shoes. NB you've got a winner, stick with it. Read more I bought these recently just as anniversary gift for my self. I have the New Balance 1500v3 which i do like very much. These are even better with the stitched tongue and the new BOA Lacing system. I did have to return the 10.5 EE for 11 EE. I wear 9.5 in skechers brand, 10.5EE in 1500v3, and now 11 EE in 1500v4 or T2. please keep that in mind if you too plan on ordering. I havent tried these while running yet but so far, they are very comfortable while lounging around or walking around. I wish there was more color options for the BOA system but for now, these will suffice. By the way, I love the BOA lacing system!. Great shoes. Read more I have wide flat feed that over pronate, and this is the best running shoe I have ever worn. I tried the 1500v3, really liked them but felt they were too narrow and the phantom fit curled up proving to be a distraction while running.

They feel great with no socks, and the BOA closure distributes weight evenly. Excited to use these in triathlons. Read more I was really psyched to get these and I still like them, but... I had the 1500v3 and loved them. I like the concept of the boa closure but the thick straps make them less breathable than the laced models.

I am genuinely amazed. Definitely recommend these quality running shoes for any activity you may throw at them. Read more I typically love Saucony Kinvara's but when I won a gift card to a store that didn't have them, I gave the Nike Free RN's a try. They are natural and comfortable - somewhat minimalist as far as not a lot of unnecessary cushioning and pronation-correcting stuff that you don't need. So if you are used to that, ease into these by rotating them in gradually until you are used to them. I'm a high mileage runner (40-60 miles per week), mostly on roads but a good chunk on trails too, so I expect shoes to hold up. I put in over 600 miles on the last pair of Nike Free RN's, so I thought I would give them a go again, especially when I found them on sale for cheaper than my Kinvara's. My only gripe on the Nike Free's is their soul design leads to getting little rocks lodged in the bottom due to their flexible design. They are great shoes though and hold up well. Read more I'm an all or nothing guy on shoes: They're either great and I love them or I hate them immediately and will never change my mind. I loved these. They're very light, the grey colour scheme that I chose is pretty subdued. I've had great experience with the longevity of Nikes.

Excellent overall construction, size was perfect - no risk for web orders if you know your Nike size. While its very convenient getting them this way, especially if you are in a rural area with not many options to try on shoes in person, it also leaves you with surprises. I had an earlier version of the shoe's series in my size (9.5US because I have wider feet) that fit perfectly. They had maybe a little extra wiggle room for the toe, but not so much that it felt like way too much space. So I sent back out for the 9.5US and just only use them casually, not for running or much activity. So light, and yet such comfort when striking pavement.. This is not a trail runner, so if you plan to run on trails, rocks, sand..this is not the shoe for you, but if you're running on a track, pavement, asphalt, etc...these are love. Read more Love them.

I was disappointed with the shoe overall. The shoe is comfortable, even without my orthotics, and they look great, but the outer webbing/structure (separate from the actually weaving of the shoe itself) arrived separated from the shoe on the left foot and several other portions on the left followed suit. The shoe is a bit snug on the top of my foot but its stretching/breaking in as a weat them. And Ive had many asics shoes and 10.5 have always fit well. It is made to look like gel. The shoe feels like you have blocks of wood on your feet. I usually love the shoes. I freaking love these shoes. Im a ER nurse and I can confirm these do very well for walking and standing 12-14 hours a day. I have super wide feet so Im limited to what shoes I wear, these are awesome. Other than that, theyre great for running, walking, standing, and super light and comfy all day. I no longer run marathons, but I still wear ASICS for walking and casual wear. These are well-cushioned and accommodate my very wide foot comfortably. Awesome shoe, delivery time, and ASICS fan since being a USMC vet!. Asics run true to size for me...as I wear a 13 in Saucony and Asics. The shoe arrived and was happy with how it looked, due to my limited choices because of my shoe size. Put them on, laced them up, Perfect fit what more could I ask. How about a comfortable shoe. For some Reason this shoe on the outer arch support has something that DIGS into your arch (or lack of, as I have pretty flat feet). Feel like someone is pressing their thumb as hard as they can into your outer arch. My running days are over but I still browse Amazon for discounted Asics. I'm a fan of the Contend-4 and bought the same size in this Scram 4 and these seem just a bit larger. No doubt it's the model of the shoe but I typically wear a 12 wide and could easily go with an 11.5 or 11 in this Scram 4. But like I said, I bought these for the unique design and the camo is low-key enough to not be too busy on top.	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Scram-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B07DM2XL37?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07DLGPQDR&psc=1

Great trainer or racer, unmatched comfort and durability. Good: I've been running in the Boston Boost 6 for over a year now. One pair has over 700 miles and the Boost foam is still working it's magic despite the tread wearing a little thin (that there is anything at all is a testament to the Continental rubber sole). The upper on this shoe is amazingly soft and comfortable without being formless (i.e., not flyknit-like at all). Shoe locks down tight, has enough support for an everyday trainer and enough pep to race all the way up to marathon distance. The only reason I own other shoes is because I believe in the physiological benefits of running in different shoe types regularly. Other: Larger runners (over 200 lbs) may prefer a little more boost support--check out the supernova instead. I've gone through many a running shoe in the past 8 years I actually started caring about my foot wear and these are my favorite pair of all around running shoes I've ever had. That small bit of weight reduction makes a huge difference. Comfort: The biggest surprise running with these is how much cushion there is given the weight. Bottom Line: These are marketed as competition shoes, but I see little reason why they couldn't be used as trainers as well. They don't have the typical comfort and durability issues that many competition shoes seem to have, and they perform quite well on roads and dirt tracks. Would definitely buy again. Read more I've had two pairs of these over the past 2 months and I've run in them a fair amount while training for an upcoming marathon. Neither pair is looking like it's breaking down too much yet, and both still work well and fit very comfortably. I imagine I'll get 500+ out of each pair, which is pretty solid. The price seems a bit steep, but after breaking down a lot of other shoes within 300 miles, it's nice to have something that is a bit more durable, so I guess my overall shoes expenditure hasn't changed much. The lightness of the shoe while maintaining a good amount of cushion is great, the traction is pretty good, and the overall fit and breathability are great. This seems like a great marathon trainer, and I'll be happy to buy more pairs in the future. Absolutely awesome running shoes. Thanks to the Boost padding, after the run my feet are the only parts of me that DON'T hurt. I got a size 12 for my size 11 1/2 feet, since they purportedly run a little small, and they fit like sleek, light, bouncy foot-gloves (as opposed to German gloves, which are called hand-shoes). Fit is very good, but these are advertised as having arch support and I don't think they have noticeable support at all. Insole is removable but kinda cheap feeling. Okay, it IS cheap-feeling but, overall, I like these a lot, and I'm a female with a wide toe-box who generally has to buy guy shoes in order to feel comfortable in athletic shoes. Not bad, need to break this in first though. I'd say this is a great shoe to add to your ""running shoe rotation"". This are really nice, really light shoes. however I just noticed that they did not last even a year. Do not waste $70-80 bucks on this shoes if you are an active athlete. I used to wear them to run, go to the gym and play table tennis, also used them on my way to work.

Ive been a fan of the Mizuno brand for many years, and have been looking in vain for the best all-purpose exercise shoe to suit my needs. Im pleased to relate that this particular brand of Mizuno shoe has proven its superiority over its peers in general comfort, fit, and quality of the shoe. I no longer run as often as I used to, but when I do these shoes have proven their worth a time and time again. Historically, Ive found the Mizuno brand of shoe to run a bit smaller than traditional brands like Nike or Adidas. Nevertheless, I would caution against sizing up a half size since these shoes stretch out or expand after several outings or exercise sessions. I wear a size 11D and these shoes are a perfect fit for my feet. For trips to the gym, long walks with my dog, or most any other activity the standard Mizuno insole is fine. I hope this review helps those searching for a great all-around athletic shoe that offers considerable support, elasticity, comfort, and quality. 5 star review for 5 star merchandise. These shoes were fantastic in the fit. Probably the most comfortable shoe I've ever owned. I really want to buy another pair, but know they'll fall apart again. A set of Odor Eaters insert took care of the smell problem. Determined fit through Mizuno's website - where they have a handy guide to compare shoe size from other popular running shoes. So I ended up with the perfect fit. I have a hard time finding shoes that fit my wide, flat foot, but these do the trick. Also, I'm a heavier runner who also does triathlons, and I must say I really enjoy the comfort of these shoes. They're a little crazy in the looks department, and I wish the material wouldn't get dirty quite so easily. But, they are fairly light for their size and really comfortable. I highly recommend these shoes. They are VERY much worth the money Shoes are super comfy with a lot of padding and some sort of spring mechanism on the heel. Great from running with bad knees. Not five stars only because they are noticeably heavier than other well made expensive running shoes. I want to be honest I tried 26 pair of Nike, made in the USA NB, now very narrow Assics, Adidas....	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Wave-Horizon-Running-Shoes/dp/B076XRQTB4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B079Y7RCDL&psc=1

Best pair of athletic shoes I have ever owned. The cushioning is superior, and the stability is excellent. As a late-comer to the running game, I may get tired, my lungs may burn, my legs may tire, but my feet NEVER hurt. So there I was, on the morning of a 5K after not having run at all (or done any sort of cardio) in a year, wearing brand-spanking new running shoes that haven't been worn in at all -- I was prepared for the worst but it turns out I needn't have worried at all. The shoes were comfortable the whole time, good cushioning and stability, breathed well, no chafing or friction issues... I get the impression that I could have ordered 1/2 larger number or Wide. They are very comfortable from the heel. I bought them because they were at a good price ( almost 60% off). The shoe fits comparably to the wave rider, and definitely has more cushion. Actually, the running experience with them is great- my feet feel great even after I worked up to 27 miles in a week. I've only put about 100 miles in, and noticed substantial wear-in starting around mile 80. Given their poor durability, I'm not sure I would recommend, although they are extremely comfortable and offer a great cushion. Mizumo Wave Sky Running Shoe is a only recent discovery for me: hitherto I only used Nike Air Max, and, though their appearance in most cases left much to be desiredthey looked like insectsI found them very comfortable. But Mizumo's shoes are a whole category above Nike's Air Max, for they provide support that is nothing short of exceptional, and at a considerably better price. I highly recommend these outstanding shoes to anyone. I've tried every brand of running shoe in my lifetime, and quite frankly nearly all have been ""good."" These Mizuno's are a step above all of the others...great support, great fit, well made, and crazy comfortable. Love these shoes. Loved the style of shoes but were too narrow in toe area and had to be returned. I am a Amazon prime member. I am very pleased with the support and cushioning of the shoe. After wearing them for a few days without running, I ran the 5K and the shoes were better than expected."	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Wave-Sky-Running-Shoes/dp/B06WW97NXJ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N28YI5I&psc=1

He still plays basketball daily in PE and prefers running to school (close to 2 miles) over taking the bus. These sneakers are holding up very well for his level of activity. Hopefully they'll last for half the school year, at least. Good neutral running shoe. I shoe does fit me very well, just slightly snug. Breathability is good. So far the shoes are showing no signs of wear. sole is firm and shoe is very light (both very good) but it doesnt receive the foot well and has a bump in the ball (not heel) of the foot. These were inexpensive, and are nice looking. I like the style and the fit is good although most Asics athletic shoes I've bought have better insoles. All my other ASICS shoes are 11.5 4E, but in these I am going to need a 12 4E. They are comfortable though. For the price, they are pretty good.	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-T825N-0193-Asics-Amplica-Running/dp/B0714BW5BV?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077H1MXDS&psc=1

Love the Knit feel. If you have escalantes, they fit exactly true to size and I find the Torins and the upper hold the foot better. Nice toe box like other Altra's - i have 5 different shoes from Altra

Pros
- Good cushioning
- Great sock like upper
- Seem to be cooler and less blister prone than other Altra shoes in high heat
- Big toe box, not too narrow or too big (like duo)
- Lightweight and nimble, doesn't feel as heavy as it is

Cons
- I dont like the smaller, narrow laces as they tend to create some pressure points when lacing up
- Jury still out on the durability of the sole...seems more fragile
- Colors are meh

Not as fast as Escalantes, but more cushioning and better for me in hotter weather and for longer runs over 7+ miles
Read more These shoes are very comfortable to wear while running. Interestingly, the feet dont slop around the large toe space because of the laces. I also liked the support features of this shoe. There is a bit more support foam than usual for a running shoe, but I can feel the road just fine (and the extra cushioning is appreciated). The heel is held in place by a pice of thin fabric, which I find comfortable since with other types of heel holds I get a lot of blistering. All in all, Im happy with my purchase. Read more At first these were great - super comfortable. Width is perfect, it allows my duck shaped feet to spread like a zero drop foot should and not wear an edge blister on the forefoot. The knit feels like a true supportive sock around my feet. Literally for the first time in years I can run without the pain of an edge blister or toenail issue. I was able to concentrate on form and fitness not overcome a blister. Well done Altra. You make shoes that allow the foot to spread and act naturally, you got this right, keep it. Shoes fit great one half size smaller than Hokas. I especially like the close to the ground feel of zero drop and how this encourages proper strike.

Top notch. I know they are a trail running or ""multi surface running shoe"", but after seeing the sheer volume of users who take to the black top with them I decided to bite. The grip felt like I had cleats on. I only did this as many other reported a great road running experience, and I feel they came up short in that regard. As far as trail running goes: are their better shoes out there. Yes. And lastly, as I forgot to mention above, the fit was perfect. I expected better from Asics. The last pair of Asics that I bought were outstanding and lasted about four years through some pretty rough treatment. I haven't even had the chance to get rough with these yet and they are already causing me to trip because the sole is catching on everything as I walk or run. Fit is good, comfort is good. So far the only shoes I've found that are comfortable on my large and wide feet (with narrow ankles). They are good in summer and winter too. Normally I have to go with extra-wide, but with these shoes the normal widths (D) are comfortable  you've just got to wear them a day or two to break them in and then they are GREAT.

That's my experience, but I guess everybody's feet are different. Not everybody has wide, hard-to-please feet like mine. I use these as my go to gym shoes now, and I love them. Not only do these fit like the Nikes, they also offer enough support for my plantar fasciitis that I can walk most of the day without too much pain. Those miles, are gentle, walking on paved roads, in dry weather, always with Darn Tough socks, and alternating shoes every day, so they are never worn on consecutive days. The shoes I was alternating with these, were a pair of Sketchers I received as a gift. They were so much more comfortable, that I always ended up scheduling my long mileage days, on the days I was due to wear the Sketchers. The exterior held up great)

Be careful if you buy these shoes, the quality just isn't there. The worn hole is in a pretty bad spot for pictures, but I did my best in attaching a couple images showing it"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Venture-Running-Shoe/dp/B00NUZCFKK?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00Q2JC290&psc=1
204	24	On Cloud X	['Rubber sole', 'On Inc Mens Cloud X, Storm/Flash, 8 D(M) US']	I am an avid Ironman competitor and the shoes saved my race season. Now the thing was running shoes is different for everyone so I recommend you find the shoe this right for you by going to a local shop and get it fitted first. Now I have finally got past the plantar fasciitis issue and successful race at Ironman Chattanooga. They look Awesome, feel great. I'm an athletic guy that runs around once a week and plays lots of tennis. Not a serious runner. I bought them because they looked really cool, they are unique among what you see in US shoe stores and I plan on running a half marathon pretty soon. I would call these a lightweight running show for someone with an efficient gate. Breath well also. I supinate and this shoes work fine with it. Very pleased. I like them, so far so good, Im in the Army and we do a lot of running every week so I use them a lot. Awesome shoes great for long distances Nice and comfortable shoe that's used primarily at the gym.

205	25	Adidas Supernova ST	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Runner type: stable', 'ENERGIZED STABILITY uses dual density boost cushioning on the medial side to support a smooth, responsive ride', 'Engineered mesh upper is a lightweight, breathable second skin providing a supportive, comfortable fit', '', '']	"I agree with what others have mentioned here regarding the heel issue. I had no heel issues whatsoever on those, but with these I feel like I am slipping out of the shoes with each stride I take. This is a real bummer for me, as I have been locked into the adidas supernova shoe game as my runners for yeeeeeeaaaaaars and I've been able to order them with confidence without having to go try them on, etc. etc. Fit-wise they a perfect fit for me, but with this slippage business I need to look for another brand now, because these just don't work the way they used to. If you've been a happy veteran of the Supernova product line, I recommend either trying these on first at an actual store or being prepared to return them. I really wish I'd tried them on *before* I had performed my customary shoe-goo application to the toes. I'm not a hardcore runner, but for me, I just love these shoes. The shoe feels good, and if anything, I feel really solid and sure-footed in them. Also, they have a comfortable fit, vs my other running/trainers which tend to be a little tight and restrictive in all sorts of spots. My neutral foot is solidly planted and it feels neutral, but supportive, to me. The sole also provides a good cushion for my heavier frame without feeling too soft or bouncy. But after getting used to these, I found them attractive and not weird looking at all... They actually look good to me. I'm pretty sure they will not squeak, and will break-in much quicker on concrete and pavement. Lastly, the fit was fantastic for me, other brands tend to fit a bit tight in the toe-box (too narrow) for me, however these were perfect. Usually good shoes for me are Adidas and NB.

Of note, there were two spots on either side of the toe box that I thought would be pressure points if my feet would ever swell. I even tested it after some crazy walking/foot/leg work for a couple days, and all was great. I find these shoes are comfortable, capable of supporting my weight through 30 minute runs (I think even further, but that will come next month). I corrected it with a simple lacing method I've used for years to minimize heel slippage and they feel fine. The upper is very breathable and keeps my feet cool in some pretty warm and humid weather. Two things I find a great ""pros"" - the Boost cushioning and the Continental rubber outsole. This creates a loop between these final two eyelets. Cross your shoe string over to the opposite side and feed it through the loop you just created with the laces. This lacing method gives you a more secure seating of the foot into the shoe, minimizing if not eliminating heel slippage. The Boost returns energy better than any other running shoe I've ever used. I'm hopeful the cushioning will last more than 400 miles. To be honest, this is the primary feature that led me to try these shoes. Outsoles on most of the current running shoes are made from rubber compounds that seems to wear quite easily. Thus may work for others, but I wear through outsoles like these in around 200 miles or less. I'll update on the shoes as the months roll on, but I think these are going to be favorite shoes for a bit. UPDATE: Still like the shoes. I have over 100 miles on each of two pairs and they are holding up just fine. The Boost midsole shows no sign that I can see of midsole compression. I have found that I now prefer Boost midsoles over any others that I have tried (Air, Gel, etc.). Boost seems to provide much greater energy return than any of the others. I feel that making the heel counter without this notch would fix the slippage issue and not seriously impact the comfort of the shoe. I would recommend this shoe to anyone who needs a little bit of stability and is not wanting to spend a huge chunk of change on more expensive shoes. The cushioning and energy return of the Boost middle is great, the upper fits well and I've not noticed any tight spots"	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Supernova-Running-Shoe/dp/B01NCAF2I3?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N9JXCDF&psc=1
206	26	Altra Lone Peak 4.0	['NA', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Durable mesh upper with integrated tongue', 'Improved, grippier MaxTrac rubber', 'StoneGuard resembles the skeletal structure of a foot', 'Stack Height: 25mm', '', '']	Seems like the lone peak and superior had a baby. Really comfortable shoe. These fit great as a size 10. Has that Altra roomy toe box, and seem like an upgraded 3.0 and not a weird foamy slipper like the 3.5. will update the review once I put some miles on them. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up on fit. These Lone Peak 4.0s fit true to size, a big deal for Altras. They have great grip, and they do not slip. Putting 12 miles on the 4.0s on a hilly trail run today, these were confidence inspiring, probably more so than the 3.5s. I think the trade off was worth it. I mightve given the 4.0 a 4.5 star rating if that were possible but they are better than a 4 star rating. Overall Altra has produced another winner, just know the minor trade off and make a decision for you. For me, Altra Lone Peak 4's are extremely comfortable, highly functional walking and hiking shoes. Well padded, supportive footbed. Good arch support, but not too much. Wide toe box, making for great comfort at front of foot. The result is a shoe that stays firmly on the foot, goes uphill and downhill very well and has sustained comfort and support for walking, even on hard surfaces. Add to this that these shoes are pretty lightweight, and you have a shoe ideally suited to travel. Not these shoes -- they fit like gloves without being constricting at all. Laces untied, they feel like slippers. This is not an problem for me, it is a plus. These Altras will get wet pretty fast in the rain or on wet ground. If you want waterproof shoes, then look elsewhere -- I have leather hiking shoes for wet conditions and I take good care of them. Sometimes companies that make a really great product just discontinue it, and I did not want that to happen to me. He said this is the first time in his life that he was able to take shoes out of the box and be 100% happy and comfortable. Comfortable AF. You will love them if you have feet. I love love love the open, wide toebox so much I immediately ordered another pair to wear as my work boots. Our feet were soaked but I was amazed at the grip I had on this fast-hike/trail run with a 50# pack. Hope Altra begins offering more shoes in 14 because im Hooked. Love these. Thanks. I love Altra running shoes and already have several other models, including this same shoe in the RSM version. I got this pair for trail running and light hiking in warmer or hot weather. I have wide flat feet and these shoes make going farther down the trail so much easier and enjoyable. In fact, they double as my street running shoe while Im living out of a suitcase, as well. I typically wear a 9 to 10 in most types of shoes and boots and I ordered the 9 1/2 which work perfectly for me. Altra is my favorite athletic shoe brand as they work for my feet better than any other brand Ive tried (Nike, Saucony, Brooks, ASICS, New Balance, Adidas, and a few others not worth mentioning).	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-AFM1855F-Mens-Trail-Running/dp/B079RP296D?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07FQJQ49T&psc=1

I'm sooooo happy. I can go for nice long walks with my dogs and go shopping, without any pain or concerns about how long it will take before I can't take another stap. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I love them. I thought these were going to be a waste of money but then I started using these as walking shoes and surprisingly I can walk in these for hours. I recommend these for walking NOT running. They were a dream outta the box. They felt like walking on clouds and no breaking in period. So I went with the next generation and it's been nothing but disappointment. These are crap! shoes look great, fit and feel very nice at first, until I started running. I had Gemini 2 before, they worked great and I would buy them again, but they don't make them anymore. When it works, it works great and it is very accurate even on a treadmill. These are great. Very good support and cushion. I know these are technically running sneakers but they perform well for my level of exercise. I have this exact shoe in another colour that I absolutely loved running in. Having had such a great experience I decided to get the same shoe in another colour and went with this item. The arch support!, lateral stability and plantar surface impact absorption have been a godsend to protecting my feet, knees and back.

I also have some minor issues with my ankles and joints, but these sneakers helped to make my work day better. Im strongly recommending that you purchase from another supplier.

210	0	Adidas Energy Cloud 2	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'adidas', 'Imported']	The 1/2 size give a little room at the tip and Im fine with that. I like the style of the shoe, and I ordered these because of the cloudfoam soles, like my other pair has. Unfortunately, these do not feel as if youre walking on a cloud, but more like rocks. My other pair of cloudfoam Adidas has a very soft insole and is very comfortable, but these, not so much. When I buy sneakers, I usually buy them a half size plus for comfort, but even though I bought these size 10 and they are so tight. They are very nice shoes but I only give 4 stars because the size has a flaw I bought these in size 10 for my son and he loves them. Theyre true to size, very soft and comfortable, and he loves how breathable they are. He doesnt use them for sports of any kind, I got them because he liked the way they looked and because he wanted/needed a shoe that breathes to help with his sweaty teenager feet. These work perfectly. Also, he has wide feet and these fit him perfectly and comfortable , hes definitely getting an other pair when the time comes. Well I gave 4 stars only because at the tip of the shoes they go narrow, to the point of creasing. So I just received these today just put them onand they fit really good. I've been wearing them for years and the black option is great that it can fit in casual setting as well. Sizes go above 13 which is great as I often find it hard to find my size. And the 0.5 increment means u can get the perfect fit These shoes are absolutely amazing, literally like walking on a cloud. My dad has diabetes and has a hard time finding shoes that fit well and are cozy. Buy them you wont regret it I like the shoe looks good the Neel is soft would have liked if they werent so narrow. 91/2 is what I wear a size 10 would been too long I just wish they fit a little looser I really like the style I'm not a runner, so I can't rate the shoes as running shoes.

I needed something I could walk around the house and grounds without waking everyone up or something I didn't have to avoid walking around the weeds with without armoring up and checking the mail without 15 lbs of leather and steel... I love these shoes. Very comfortable- and just cuz I bought them I've even taken to walking down to the corner and back (20 mins a day) instead of driving. As far as running- they hit the sweet spot where you aren't worried about hurting your knees and ankles doing normal on the pavement jogs (I'm a truck driver with bad legs and the fact I'm jogging at all with these is amazing)-- if you're an elitist with time on your hands by all means spend twice as much money for the same results... if you're a real working person- these may still be pricey but in my eye a great value for what you get... Solid, light,comfortable and breathable.... 5 stars to asics. These newest Quantum 360 4's are really attractive shoes. Fit is on par with the rest of the 360 lineup. These are a bit more refined, I like the lacing system preferring the short setup myself. They are a bit warm as noted already but in exchange you get a nice toe box that will hold its shape much better than previous models. This improves the aesthetic aspect of the shoe greatly in my opinion. While they are a bit heavier than most I feel more than compensated by the comfort provided by them. They are some of the most comfortable shoes around. The uppers in the Quantum 4 will not rip or tear like the original Quantum 360's did, instead as I mentioned the upper is a really strong material that will retain its shape and surely take a solid beating before any problems occur. Overall I can't say anything negative about the shoe. I'm very happy with them. To me those are both improvements over the last gen shoe and again provide an enhanced aesthetic appeal to the shoe. If you have been a fan for awhile or are buying your first pair I believe you'll be impressed. Read more This is an awesome shoe. I will recommend this any time to anybody. These shoes are slightly on the expensive side, but worth it when buying older models at amazon. Read more Very comfortable shoe. The lace option is a great idea to relieve pressure spots from laces. These shoes are very hot, even in winter my feet were very warm, I'm not looking forward to summer. In your hand they feel about the same weight as the Cumulus or Nimbus, but while running it feels much heavier, almost like running in sand. Definitely not worth the price over the Cumulus or Nimbus. Upon first glance these kicks are really nice. I have and have had many many other pairs of Asics, be certain that the toe uppers on this model are made especially different than the rest. Holy comfortableness. NEVER AGAIN. I've known that ASICS and Brooks were made for gym/workout/running specifically and were probably good, but price always deterred me. I'll keep my Nike's for casual wear, but never again for workouts. I run 6 miles daily and these are terrible going to try to buy a few pairs of 24 or 25s to bridge and hope that the 26 is better	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Quantum-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B07D7RYTWT?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07DP9MNRF&psc=1
212	2	Nike Air Zoom Vomero 12	"[""Men's Size 7.5 US"", 'A comfort-fit collar provides cushioned ankle support while a thick midsole sockliner creates a supremely plush feel.', 'Nike Zoom Air units in the heel and forefoot create a responsive, springy step to help propel you through your miles.', 'A lighter, more durable traction pattern offers better energy return than previous versions with updated rubber on the crash pad that helps cushion impact.', 'Flywire cables integrate with the laces for a secure fit']"	They feel great while walking or running. If you want great cushioning, like walking on a pillow, these do the job. I hope Nike keeps the Vomeros with this level of cushioning forever. I have continued to buy the Vomero ever since and this shoe still continues to be the best fitting running shoe I have ever bought. Designed to protect my legs from the pavement. I don't come home limping after a run and it's so nice. I have been buying Nike Vomero for years and they have always been great. I think these are some kind of knock-off, as they do not fit as well as my previous Nike's and they do not feel the same - no support for my foot, where as my old ones supported my foot well for a year without any problem, and I wore them daily. This is pretty standard for US shoes. I'm going back to buying directly from Nike from now on.PS: I bought these from an Amazon Seller called Red Pine Hill - not from Nike directly I run multiple times a week about 4 miles. They were stiff and I felt every foot strike like I was wearing a brick. I needed a well cushioned shoe that was reasonably lightweight with good rebound so you don't lose all your energy in the cushion. These shoes are PERFECT for that. They are better cushioned than the Nimbus was even with the models I loved. They give more rebound as well and my mile times have gone down which is nice as well as not feeling as drained to achieve higher rates of speed. They were instantly comfortable and remain so. Contrary to some concerns, the toe box was just fine after coming to it from the ASICS. I love running in these shoes. I highly recommend them for anyone who needs more cushion for walking and running. I like the shoes. I like the color. Amazon delivers great as always. I only mention it in case you are a collector or something or like to store your shoes in the box. The box had me worried but the shoes were fine, brand new, unworn perfect condition. I bought these as a good value and will use them for more casual wear and walking the dog to reduce wear on my running shoes. These would probably be fine for running but feel a bit stiff and have more heavily padded uppers than I prefer. These are typical Nike fit so about 1/2 size small in comparison to other brands Best shoes I've owned. I have wide feet and was concerned about the fit, but the regular width fits my feet just fine	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Air-Zoom-Vomero-12/dp/B00BEWAL7K?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B004TTKCOM&psc=1
213	3	Hoka One One Speedgoat 2	['Synthetic', 'Heel-toe drop: 4.5mm', 'Weight: 9.8 oz (size 9)', 'Neutral stability', 'Balanced cushion']	These are the best running and dog-walking shoes I've ever had. I discovered the HOKA brand several years ago when it was recommended by my sports doctor. These (the Speedgoat 2) offer the best and thickest cushion, traction and support without feeling at all squishy. They are heavenly. Thin stretchy top, so the size is a little forgiving, but had I ordered my typical size they would have needed to go back immediately. Lots of cushion and that takes a bit to get used to; were I an avid runner I might wonder if it was too spongy and question my control and stability, but for a day walking at an amusement park or the short runs I do, I'm okay with the light weight and general comfort; they could just use an extra few mm in length. These shoes are great for trail running and have been really comfortable. The toe box is narrow but it doesn't bother me but may others. Really liking these shoes. So I went with these and I'm glad. They have so much cushion it's like deep couch sitting. I have purchased numerous pairs of Hoka trail shoes in the past and these are my favorite pair so far.	https://www.amazon.com/HOKA-ONE-Mens-Speedgoat-Running/dp/B01N6J3LAJ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CKPN678&psc=1

In terms of stability and support, which is also important for Plantar's runners, the Mizuno's are good, but he felt the Saucony and Asics were marginally better. My husband is a mid-strike, mostly neutral runner and, according to him, at no time did he ever feel hard ground contact wearing these shoes (a feat considering he is over 200#). ""it was as angels throwing pillows at my feet"" lol ;) Lots of cushion, lots of energy return. He felt these were the best running shoes he's ever owned - and there have been many over the years. He finds them to be lightweight, breathable and extremely comfortable. If you don't have issues with your feet and you like the natural feel of ground contact when you run, these shoes may not be for you. I spend 8 to 12 hours standing as a pharmacist for my entire professional life, and had never really paid attention to the basic support and pronation caused by the running shoes I favored. I've remained true to this model, keeping at least three separate pairs at all times so I can rotate them on a daily basis to allow them to dry out, air out. This keeps the glues intact and enhances longer life of the shoes. I have been buying Mizuno for my son and We are happy with them. I'm so happy with them. The 12.5 size fit my feet perfectly. I recently got a membership at Orangetheory, which has a lot of running, and running felt amazing with these new Wave Rider 21 shoes. I'll definitely continue to purchase Mizuno Wave Riders in the future. Very, very impressed with these shoes. INITIAL REVIEW (November 27, 2017): Very comfortable. Attempting to increase my walking skills from a completely sedentary, behind-the desk lifestyle. I did buy some cheap heal inserts that support the outside of the heal with a few degrees of lift and put them just under the padding. The Wave Rider design started moving away from what I liked - smooth, neutral, fairly light, fast feel, with a wider toe area. However, after a few runs, I'm glad I got these. Same grippy sole, cushioning, and feel as before... which is a good thing. Those were solid runners but a bit firm for my taste. These fit pretty much the same but with more softer cushioning throughout -- great for bigger runners. Just a great neutral running shoe. Mizuno deserves credit on this one. Still love the shoes though -- amazing comfort. They look great with the blue color!"	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Wave-Rider-21-Running/dp/B06WW97P1Z?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071ZM33KM&psc=1

Comfortable cushion. Overall I would say it's a solid shoe. I really liked this shoe but there was one thing that made me return them. The shoe is true to size (I'm a 12 in free runs and adidas running shoes, got these in 12). Super lightweight, glove like fit on the upper. Extremely comfortable. If the tongue had something to keep it from sliding it would greatly improve this shoe in my opinion. im gonna give these 5 stars for now. The last 2 models 7, and 8, have felt more like the Kinvara. I'm glad that with these 8s I feel more support from the mesh. I love um. Lol. Just less than 100 miles on my first pair and they are a great minimalist middle distance shoe. 80/20 asphalt to trail and they do great on both. They are marketed as cross country, but I like them on the road, too. Longest distance in them so far is 8-10 miles, but could see doing a half in them if you like a minimum feel. I took a chance and switched brands and styles of shoes 10 days before a half marathon; and I'm happy to report that the Fastwitch 8s are completely amazing and I set a new PR from just six weeks ago when I was running in my alter torns. I thought they would be easier to see. He is pleased with them. GOOD FOREFOOT PROTECTION AND NICE TOE OFF. EXCELLENT TRACTION ON PAVED ROADS WHERE I DO MOST OF MY TRAINING.

The Glycerin is a comfortable shoe. These are by far better of a running shoe for me. Nice shoe very comfortable. Awesome product and designs always are flawless. Brooks always work well for my feet, so far this shoe is great for my high arches and chronic plantar fascitis. Slightly snug on the toe box- like a sock fit Unimpressed. Incredibly comfortable shoes. More mesh upper and a little less structured then the Ghost 11s so I've stuck with those for running but these are really comfortable everyday shoes.

The whole time my heel was slipping out, and that makes for too much underfoot slippage as well. The heel cup just doesn't hold the heel in securely. Good company but this shoe may need some more refinement. But that is also part of why the shoe was so comfortable. If you like cushy, those models were be best. Since the 3.0, Altra firmed up the sole, which many will like. Luckily I have a stock of the earlier models. I pronate and need a shoe with enough support to minimize pronation during my runs. The high support shoes Ive tried before were too rigid and heavy. I have tried Hoka Bondis and loved the cushioning but they lack enough support. These Altras provide the ideal support and cushioning for me. Hadnt really ever wore Altras but strangely enough they felt really good on my feet and left my feet relaxed with no aches after day of hikes. Super impressed with them and wanted a pair for casual days so I chose the Altra Paradigms and wow they are probably the most comfortable shoes Ive ever owned. Amazing the difference the Altras make on my feet and could not be a happier Altra customer. These Paradigms are the real deal for comfort and looks and I so impressed with the quality and feel. My only gripe is the laces are not the color shown on Amazon and are actually black. Wish I could have received the lace colors that weee advertised?. Anyway, they are awesome shoes and no doubt youll be a satisfied customer. #altracustomer4life I started having issues with my foot pads ""burning"" with regular shoes. Local running store put me in these and they're great. I started with the 2.0 and I do love the knit upper. The 12s are perfect. We met an Altra rep at the Indy Mini expo before the new shoes (4) came out and he recommended I stay in them (not the Escalante, which he raved about). I did try Hoka, but they were binding into my forefoot on top. In my opinion Altra's road feel got way off from what I originally loved about them. These really feel good. Let's hope they stop trying to chase Nike and get back to what made Altra a true runner's shoe. Shoes fit great but i am not a runner and was weraring maybe 2 to 3 days a week to work which is a carpeted floor
and 44 DAYS not weeks but 44 DAYS THE SOLE IS COMING OFF AND SHOES INSOLE GAVE OUT 3 WEEKS AGO!. I have a large foot
for a woman and these shoes were suppose to be hi quality just cant believe they fell apart like this soo dissapointing

May be good for shorter distances on technical trails, in cooler conditions. It worked great. This shoe held up well. I did have to take it off to get dirt and rocks out that had slipped in but other than that it was perfect. Very comfortable from the first second I put them on feet never got sore wide enough for an e foot. Settled for the 305 and I am very happy with them. I primarily use the shoe for Rucking (urban hiking) and they have held up nicely. Would definitely recommend them if you have a narrower foot. Very happy with this shoe. Bought it for a Spartan Super. Didnt get to break them in before the event but they felt great and I forgot about them immediately...until I noticed what amazing traction I had and how well they drained. I definitely recommend them. This is my second pair of inov-8 roclite 305 - it's a good, rugged trail runner that sits low enough to be stable while having a solid enough midsole/rock plate so as not to be uncomfortable when worn for multiple days or for long sections of road walking. Grip/lugs are great across various surfaces, weight is accpetable, styling is ok. 8mm drop is not so high you feel unstable, and not so low that you need be careful with tendons/calves etc. I got a pair of adidas hiking shoes the same day and the difference was significant. I will keep these for street walking but they won't be seeing any hiking duty Great shoes, very lightweight, sticky to the trail.

They seem to fit the same. This model of shoe has excellent cushion fore foot and heel. Hope they arent discontinued. My last 2 pairs of ASICS were the Gel-Kayano, this time I wanted a little more cushion and these Gel-Flux 5's are SO comfortable. Like running on marshmallows. I run 12-15 miles per week, 52 yrs old, and these shoes give just enough support and comfort. I do not have a very high arch but there was zero arch support in these and they are heavy. Perfect for me because I am a size 5 1/2 . This is a great shoe for Jazzersize and other exercise programs - all the ladies wear them . I really like these shoes, I've worn Converse for many years and as I get up there a little bit in age my feet are not able to take the converse. I searched around for a pair of shoes with great support and this is what I came up with. The color goes great with many of my scrub tops. I love these shoes. Great comfort and value. Ive run thousands of miles in ASICS shoes getting a new pair/style every 300-500 miles but this is one of the most comfortable pairs yet. No breaking in needed, they are great right out of the box. Highly recommend I recommend wearing casually before taking it for a run. Still a great running shoe. Love, love the color combo.

They still squeak and they have days, for lack of a better way to describe it, feel like they're not broken in yet. I'd return them if it was worth the effort. I am a women but like the men's fit better. They have lots of room, super comfortable. Love the boost technology. Discovered the ""Energy Boost"" series a month before running Boston in 2015. The Adidas Energy Boost 3 has exceeded my expectations in ways that go against traditional thinking. Most shoes start off strong, but gradually become flat and unresponsive. They are just as comfortable at the end of a run as they are at the beginning. I alternate these with my trusty Asics Gel-Nimbus 18s, but they are really in a different league altogether. For me, the Boosts are a perfect combination of form and function

I had a pair of those a few years ago - in a garish bright neon green - and I loved the fit and feel. The midsole and outsole look as if they were lifted directly from the original PureFlow design. The Anthem's upper is probably slightly better, with far fewer overlays and seams, and a bit better ventilation. Finally, at around $70 these are a very good value. Read more I was an avid fan of the pureflow 1 & 2 (owned 4 pairs of each) and read a lot of reviews saying these were very similar to them...couldnt be any more wrong.

Read more Huge fan of Brooks shoes. Originally I was very excited for this shoe when I saw it looked very similar to the original Pureflow. What I really enjoyed was the balance of cushoning and energy these shoes had. Run Happy. Quality product and VERY comfortable.

Ok, maybe not the last one (ha ha. Wishful thinking!) Seriously, they are extremely comfortable and my ankles, knees, and hips don't hurt after running as was the case with other running shoes.

238	28	Salomon X-Mission 3	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Trail runner featuring lightweight mesh upper with durable synthetic overlays in tech-style patterns', 'QUICKLACE system', '10mm heel-to-toe drop', 'Sculpted EVA foam midsole', 'Contagrip traction outsole']	I've bought 5 pairs of Salomons in the last 2-3 years, these ones fit extremely tight, almost too small. When I normally purchase, they're just about perfect, for some reason these are incredibly snug on the sides and my toe is right up against the shoe. But, the shoe is extremely light, breathes very well, and the color scheme is on point. The initial size 13 was too tight, and had to be replaced with a 14 which was a little loose, however laced tightly it affords a snug fit suitable for trail running. I've been a pretty consistent size 13 so I think it's safe to say you should purchase a 1/2 size over. By definition I am a middle aged rookie hiker (read hiking for years but let sitting on a chair in the office catch up to me) this being said the shoe is light, with good arch support and a snug fit around the heal, and instep. This is actually my casual and gym shoe also First these shoe run pretty small. The right shoe inner liner is getting ready to develop a hole too. Salomon warranty says I should return them to where I bought them and Amazon says returns are only for new unused shoes--WTF? Great--now these running shoes are only good for the recycle bin. I switched to Merrell Agility Peaks and found them to be much more comfortable, lighter, and well-made than the Salomons. Good call, they fit perfectly, with about a thumb width from the tip of my big toe. If you are looking for a shoe that has great support, arch and otherwise, and a more orthotic feel, this is it. Nice and light, but well built. In the past, I have purchased Salomon shoes that are similar in style in 10.5 US and those fit great with normal thickness socks. However, this model shoe fits like it is size 10 US. Very odd... They look really nice and are a nice quality. This shoe feels small because it has a high arch giving it a narrow feel, but comparing the insole to ASICS or Brooks of the same size, these shoes are a normal length and width. Because of the high arch, the shoe does not accommodate rigid orthotic inserts. I've run two trail half marathons in these and they performed well, giving good support and traction on uphills, downhills, field crossings and water crossings. Perfect brand new shape. Light weight and size stayed true for me. Toe box appears to fit fine. Perfect fit. They are super light and the most comfortable shoes I have. I did notice with certain thinner socks a small amount of rubbing on my right foot by my big toe	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-X-Mission-3/dp/B00ZLNVYIS?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CQK93ZH&psc=1

He wore these every day for school and they tore playing a running game at recess. Very comfortable insoles, accurate sized, and the price is too good to pass up. He loves thee shoes because it gives him the high arch he wants and the flexibility in the toes and wider feet. The blue is awesome and he is obsessed with these shoes. Great and light weight. However, the black is kind of frayed near the ASICS symbol so kinda makes it feel really cheap/made in China which is unfortunate but helps my running game a lot. Couldnt be happier with the fit and feel, my pace time has improved. I will be running in ASICS from now on For the right person, these could be good shoes at a very nice price. The fit is different from other Asics running shoes that I've worn -- too roomy for me, side-to-side. But they're nice and light, and for a casual runner (or just as a pair of ""casual"" shoes), they could be a bargain. Excellent comfort for heel heavy walkers/runners, especially on pavement. It's light and easy to pack on trips.

240	0	Altra Timp	['Fabric,Manmade,Mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Ideal Uses: Ultrarunning, Long Distance, Fast Packing', 'Designed To Improve: Natural Foot Positioning, Toe Splay, Comfort', 'Platform: Fully Cushioned Zero Drop platform and FootShape toe box', 'Midsole: Ultralight EVA with A-Bound', 'Outsole: MaxTrac Rubber with TrailClaw']	"They've held up very well. These are a good balance of zero drop with some cushion for those of us who aren't minima yet. Shoes are all different for each person so I can't say if it will work for you specifically, but if you're fat footed like me with ""sensitive feet"" looking to move to something less cushiony/obtrusive, this might work for you. I gave this shoe only 4 stars, because I do not believe it is the best for a heavier runner or someone who tends to be heavier footed. To be clear I am a huge fan of Altra shoes, so I am being honest here. I like the way they fit, I do normally wear a 8.5 in regular shoes and some Altras, but I had to go up half size and that is generally the case with other Altras as well. That is not a big deal, but Altra touts this shoe as a ultra endurance shoe, but as mentioned earlier, I truly believe that is for those that are light in body weight. I wore the Altra Olympus a few weeks earlier for about 45 miles on a 100K race and those held up fine, my feet did not hurt nor my ankles. I asked the race director who was wearing these how they felt and he said they were really good. After looking at the reviews and his opinion and Altra's claim that they are the sweet spot between the Lone Peak and Olympus, I got them. I really think there needs to be a rock plate added to this shoe and then it will be the sweet spot for heavier runners. I also did not think the max track on this shoe works as well as the Olympus, I hit a rock that was a little slick and slid pretty good whereas that did not happen in the Olympus. I was really hopeful for this shoe, because it is more affordable than the Olympus and it seemed that it was going to be a good all day performance shoe. These Timp Trail Runners are the best trail shoes I've ever worn. These perform perfectly. The sizing was perfect for the mens 8 I got. The lugs are the bottom are perfect for the trails around Stuttgart. I've trail run in both the Olympus and the Loan Peak, but I like these (Timp) the best. They provide the perfect amount of cushion while remaining super stable. Love the wide tow box. The tread provides great grip running both up and down hills. Even though I wear these primarily for trail running they are probably my most comfortable shoes. Very good comfortable shoe with solid support. The traction is very good in soft ground. Also they seem to push water out pretty well and dry quickly (relatively). One thing I did note was after my feet were wet for a while (it was raining with water on the trails) I noted that the bottom of my feet felt warm - like through friction. Perhaps was a combination of prolonged wet socks, wet feet, wet shoes....and/or a fit issue (e.g. laces too loose). Over all, I really like these shoes. Great lug pattern does not pick up debris
Look GREAT!
Breath very well
Cons:
Expensive. I have other pairs of Altra shoes and LOVE them, I want to love these too but they are just not right for the top of my foot and instep. The build and comfort in every other way is amazing. Fantastic shoes and great for moderate trail running and vacationing. I actually bought these for a two-week trip to the Austrian and Swiss alps and they were fantastic for traveling. Very comfortable travel shoes, light-weight and roomy. I get a lot of compliments on the look and the cool toe box. However, all that said, for legitimate trail running, especially when rocky, I would recommend the Hoka One One Speedgoat 2. Also, my foot is much more stable in the Speedgoat 2. I would still buy and use the Altra shoes for limited purposes but they just don't seem to compare under certain conditions (most) to the S2. I'm a trail runner, and really like these shoes. I was wearing the Olympus which I liked, but these feel less big, and less clunky.... Very plush cushioning, and a nice grip, even on wet rocks.."	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-TIMP-Trail-Running/dp/B01N1UUFJN?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071L432S5&psc=1

Brooks review

These shoes are great at drainage and the rubber is mostly sticky. The shoes are comfortable and I havent had any big issues on longer runs. No hot spots, all good things on that level. Folks were nice enough to swap them out after some complaining. I was pretty over it and thought I might as well see where this train was going so currently Im at 203 miles (two months) and the wear around the top of the shoes is shredding, the sole is continuing to peel but I havent had any come off yet, and the guard around the front of the foot is delaminating from the upper at the flex points. Im no beast and I run pretty consistently with the same guys who arent having these issues with their shoes. So, if you want a good shoe for wearing around and sometimes taking on trails and sometimes running, they are probably okay. And they was confortabble and nice looking. Are better very soft sole. Nice track. And they looks great. Fits great i love it."	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Caldera-2/dp/B071HM98XY?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077ZFDRSD&psc=1

These were the clear winner. Repeat buyers of Gel Nimbus will want to stay away from this shoe and find something new. All were great shoes until I got to Gel Nimbus 17. I'm not a runner; I bought them because I have plantar fasciitis exacerbated by underpronation, and these shoes showed up again and again on lists of shoes recommended for correcting that. To the good: they're lightweight, the cushioning is outstanding, and they really helped a lot with my foot pain. I'll tell you: After about four months of use, they developed holes in the top where the tip of my big toe pokes at the inside. Now, before you make the snide remark a coworker did (""maybe you should just clip your nails""), my toes are well-groomed. (There's a sentence I never thought I'd type, BTW.)

The shoe has some arch support and it has no heel lift, ample room in the toe box. With the flooded roads this time of year had a chance to see how it does in water. This shoe is a pure pleasure to run in. By far the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. The toe box has the perfect amount of room for you're feet to stretch out but still be supported. The usual great Altra product, except for chintzy laces that keep untying themselves, and are maybe 2"" too short for simple fingers. When you spread the shoe to put your foot in, it practically swallows the lace ends Yes, minus one star for chesping out on the laces. This is my second pair of Altra Superior trail runners. The tread is great for hiking on trails, and provided great traction scrambling around Strawberry Mountain in Oregon, as well as puttering around on trails in Mt Haleakala. This version 3.5 seems to have reinforced material in the areas that my older shoe started showing wear after 18 months, so I am hopeful that his pair will be more durable. These shoes are great. Can function as a road runner but is alittle less responsive. Definitely meant for the trails. I'll start with, it's still a great shoe. The rock guard is now built in, making for a much less flexible shoe. The sole, now thicker, feels like you are higher off the trail, like the Lone Peaks do. I've worn lots of Altra shoes including the original superior. This has got to be my favorite - great fit, just the right amount of cushioning for running on rocky trails. I love Altra shoes"	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072JL1JHR/ref=asc_df_B072JL1JHR1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B072JL1JHR&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Second, the shoes. Fit as expected. Boa system works flawlessly. There was a good balance of cushion and stability. For this particular pair I believe they fit to size. The Boa laces are great. Asics should fit more of their running shoes with the Boa-system . Plenty of traction and support these shoes are great they fit perfect since you can adjust the laces perfectly, most expensive shoes I've bought but worth it. Fit perfectly.

251	11	Adidas Galaxy Trail	['Textile and Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Imported', 'adidas shoes']	Anyway, loved these shoes, and at the time, the price was unbeatable. Great fit, I use these for work. Great for walking though properties and yards that are developed and undeveloped. Hold up well in wet conditions. I used them last year while helping my brother build his house. These shoes are amazing though. Very supportive. I'm sure for the experienced hardcore runner these would not be what you want but for someone like me who's just doing the occasional run these are absolutely spot on. Great traction for the Spartan Beast Race. Did a superb job in the mud and an adequate job on the wood. Seems to be lacking in arch support, especially on the right foot. My foot seems to want to come down towards the inner sidewall rather than squarely on the bottom. I have never had a pair of shoes fit like that. Left shoe seems fine. They seem like good shoes, definitely more gray than they appear in the picture, but they run very small. Definitely go up a full size. Toe box is a little narrow as well. It feels very comfortable and fits just right. It also looks great (especially in the blue and black color) and certainly can be used for just going to the gym or a jog/run. Otherwise the construction is great, shoe is super comfortable and looks great. Adidas is a good brand with a quality shoe I got these shoes almost 2 years ago now. They are still in great shape, although the soles are getting a bit worn. They hold up great.

...Except for one problem. I haven't been doing anything strenuous or intense with these shoes so I expected them to last longer. I'll update this if the issue is resolved. Excellent shoes. Going to a wider size resulted in a sloppy fit. I would recommend these shoes. They're basically the only brand that makes shoes my body likes. Kind of felt like both outer edges were really built up creating a canyon in the middle that just doesn't work. Usually new shoes have a nice spring to them. Heck, my flip-flops feel livelier. The cushion was also so hard that aside from the thin foam insole it felt about like being barefoot on concrete. On the good side they look beautiful and do appear to have better/more durable construction of the uppers than some of the Altras I've gotten in the past. I like the way they fit, I bought a half size up from my normal shoe size, which is typical for me when buying Altras, so no big deal there. I liked the sleek feel, sort of a racer like feel and I thought they would be great when running. These shoes did not work for me and I will not be trying another version of it, but they may be good for someone who needs stiff stability. I love that Altra has a very wide toe box. I use these as my nursing shoes because they are well padded, which I need for 12 hrs on my feet. This is my new favorite Altra shoe. I loved their Instinct model, but I needed more support for my over-pronation. They're both great, and I'm able to enjoy running without my knees and feet hurting. Sizing moving from the Instinct to Provision was about a 1/2 step up - I had a 9.5 Instinct which was just a bit too big, and the 9.5 Provision fits perfectly. I like them but. Altra Men's 3.0 look great and I like the concept of Zero Drop. They feel light on my feet and makes me feel like I want to run. They feel much better but stiffer and heavier.

Like the other reviewers said, the Gel-Nimbus 19 run smaller and narrower. I can't speak for the insoles as I always order a pair of green Super Feet with every pair due to plantar faciitis. I sincerely hope the next version is a return to the old fit and quality. :( I've ordered the same size Gel-Nimbus as long as I can remember. I most likely will go into the local store to try on a few different sizes of these and see if maybe the next size up fits like my normal size. I was really excited to find a deal on Amazon for the latest iteration of the Nimbus. I have been wearing these for the better part of the decade and have been very satisfied with the shoe. I am an avid runner, and require a neutral shoe with cushioning, and the Nimbus is king in this regard. However, from the second I put these on, I felt like I was in a shoe a full size too small. The toebox was super tight all around and the sizing is definitely small. I wear a normal width 9.5 in the Nimbus 18, and felt like I would need a 10.5 Wide in order to get something close to fitting. The shoes immediately went back in the box and back to Amazon. My toes are cramped beyond comprehension and it just doesnt breathe and respond like its earlier models. Ive moved to the Nike Air Vomero and the Saucony Triumph. I have been an Asics fan for years and have come to rely upon the consistency of its excellent Gel-Nimbus trainer. With each successive release since the 14, this shoe has gone downhill and has entered the land of mediocrity. And get ready for a much less cushioned ride, thanks to the upgrade to Flytefoam and noticeably less gel. You were top of your class for so long. Here's a bit of advice: stick to what works and work harder on maintaining your huge loyal user-base before you lose them forever. I loved previous pairs of shoes from this company. I put them on, and immediately enjoyed the comfort during a long day on my feet. All my other pairs are 8 and a half, and fit fine. Best shoe I have owned. They run 1/2 size big...or small I usually wear an 11...11-1/2 fit perfect.

UPPER: Quick-Dry Air Mesh.', '', '']	After wearing the 3.0's religiously on my hikes, I really love these new 3.5's. The ankle box fits my foot better and keeps it from shifting forward when I ankle lock the laces. I find them to fit my wide feet just as good as my other Altra's. I like the new built-up toe box and side material while still making use of a very breathable mesh material. Also, the new 4-point gaiter system seems like a smart change, although I have only used Dirty Girl gaiters with these so far and those are just a 2-point gaiter, which has worked fine for me. The 14's in the 3.5 fit exactly like my 13's in the 3.0. I've never worn a size 14 in any make of shoe, so I was expecting them to look like clown shoes. Just keep walking, after 15 minutes or so, they begin to feel very natural and so very comfy. I went on a 32 mile trek with 26 lb Pack weight, Wore Injinji liners, Darn tough trekking socks, with the altra 3.5's and my feet have never ever been more at home and comfortable in all the years I've been hiking or even walking for recreational . These performed better than I could have expected. They are almost a perfect fit. There is some room above my toes, But in hiking long distances, your feet swell, and I like to wear a liner sock, So the added space is just perfect to accomodate Heel padding deformed after a month (left shoe only). Amazon was kind enough to give me a full refund even though the product was outside it's return window. The shoe outside of the quality control / durability issue is great. The wide foot box is amazing, and I did like the zero drop, my first shoe of this type. That's the only reason I'm giving 3 stars. I was careful to untie the shoes when taking off and putting them on. I have tried really hard to love these shoes. They are very comfortable, they dry out quickly, and they are much cooler than I thought they would be. But there are three things I can't shake. 1. Traction is good, until you encounter wet rocks. 2. I have done a lot of intense hikes on and off trail in these and there is a lot to like, but I can't get past my knocks against them. I love these shoes. Ive never had my feet feel so comfortable while covering rugged like I have in these. They do run a bit smaller than my usual size, but going up one size created the perfect fit. My feet were relaxed and afforded the room to flex and relax throughout the extended amount of rough miles. There is enough cushion to take the impact of downhill slopes easily without the bulkiness that leads me to sometimes drag my feet. The gaiter attachment points are just an added bonus to me, and they hold strong in the back to ensure they dont come off. I highly recommend this product!. If your a hiker, In my opinion 1 size larger was the perfect fit. Good fit. I love these trail runners. Most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. Highly recommend!	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Lone-Peak-3-5-Mens/dp/B01N6JCO3W?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N5R999A&psc=1

I love these shoes. I keep coming back to ASICS, and this particular model as being my favorite running shoes. I dont want a clunky, stiff shoe. These shoes fit that bill. Comfort wise, I find they feel slipper-like. My feet feel great as I run. The fabric on the inside is soft and gentle. The soles have ample support to carry my above average body weight (200lbs) without being stiff. In terms of durability, I find they hold up better that most of my shoes. Still, like any running shoe I do replace them regularly. There is a version of these shoes without the cut outs, but I prefer the light weight. Simply I have been thru my share of mostly expensive running sneakers in the last 3-4 months. I chose these Asics to be honest, mostly on their looks.to be my every day walk around SOMETIMES running shoes. What I was not expecting was how great looking they look in person, how COMFORTABLE they actually are and very light. For the price these sneakers WAY OVER deliver on quality....I LOVE these running shoes...more than I thought I would. Great pair of sneakers..LOOKS great too. Not only is this shoe super comfortable and light, it also is one of the rare running shoes that actually looks good enough to wear casually. With the shoe industry churning out new models ever year, whenever I find a shoe I actually like I can never find it again when I need a new pair. I wish there were more shoes like these out there, but at least I should be set for a while. They work, but theyre more for walking or very casual running. Also, the toe box is a tad small, but it is not terrible. These are good looking shoes for everyday comfortable wear. I always order the same size in Asics and they have always fit. The most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, I wear nothing but asics and these truly cushion and support my feet well. I was a bit skeptical at first because I usually wear a wide shoe but these take on my shape so good, I will be buying another pair when these bite the dust (no time soon ) and I wear these everyday Terrible in the wet - there is so little contact area that when you walk in the wet your feet keep slipping	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Fuzex-Lyte-Running/dp/B01GU4DZY2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N9KOONI&psc=1
260	20	Saucony Triumph ISO 2	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'ISOFIT uppoer for dynamic fit, EVERUN topsole and landing zone for enhanced energy return and cushioning.']	"I like a smooth and plush ride that does as much as a shoe can to assist in protecting my back; all my miles are on a treadmill (again, protecting the back). I moved to Saucony with their initial Triumph ISO and loved it. Saucony's encore is even better (IMO), the ride is plush and smooth, yet it doesn't feel like you're wearing pillows on your feet. The Triumph ISO's lacing system locks your foot in place without pinching the top of your arch, there is a proper amount of tongue padding and it stands up to use. If you like a really big toe box, this might not be for you; I don't particularly like a big toe box and my feet tend towards narrow rather than wide. They perform very well at any distance, but weekend long runs are where they shine. The ride is very easy on the feet and very forgiving several miles into a long run when I start heel striking. Also plenty of response when you want to pick up the pace. After a few runs my feet adjusted/shoes broke in and were a pleasure to run in. But after numerous runs I know within the first few steps of warmup walk if it's good to go. I can easily see getting at least another 125-200 miles out of these shoes, the sole has barely worn and the ever run material appears to have plenty of life left. One run in, they are very soft and cushiony, maybe too much so (a huge break from my trail shoes). So far, I may not be overwhelmed, but I'm not disappointed. Note - I found the shoes to run just a hair small, but my normal shoe size did fit and the slight pressure I feel will likely dissipate as the shoes break in and conform to my feet. I wasn't impressed right away, but these are a great running shoe. I've run in several Saucony products (Ride, Kinvara) and although I really like Kinvaras because they are the type of shoe I prefer (low drop, light), the ISO 2 is an amazing long run or trainer shoe. They have cushioning in all the right places for comfort. The best part is that once I made up my mind to use them for a fast paced run, they felt great. These shoes are terrific. First, the ""Fit: Find the right size"" button at Amazon was excellent, and I ordered 1/2 size larger than usual, so I recommend you try it. Fit: Excellent, with plenty of room in toe box
Cushioning: Excellent front to back
Comfort/performance: Excellent both walking (at any speed) and running
Look: Best I've had from Saucony (for whom aesthetics are not, for me, a strong point)

I like the ISO 2 much better than their Ride model, of which I've gone through close to half a dozen pairs. The ISO's cushioning is superior. So is the fit, but that may simply because successive Ride models became snugger, and I should have gone to a larger size. The Asics Gel-Nimbus 17 (also purchased recently and also 1/2 size larger than usual) fit well too -- even better in the heel than the ISO 2 -- and they are the most cushioned shoes I've worn. But on the mid sole it feels a little knobby, and the (too?) superb heel cushioning makes very rapid walking (13-14 min./mile) MUCH more tiring, with times about 30 sec./mile slower. But for other walking and for running, the Asics are great too and are highly recommended. One long-time concern with Saucony Rides, which I otherwise like, is durability. I'm hoping the ISO 2 will last longer, but it's a great shoe regardless. Read more I have been a fairly loyal Asics customer for years, but I read that the toe box on Asics recent releases was considerably smaller than past models so I decided to give the Saucony Triumph ISO 2 a spin. To date, I have put approximately 20 miles, mostly on concrete, and I have found these shoes to be extremely comfortable. They are better cushioned than the Asics I am accustomed to wearing, and they maintain my neutral gait very well. As an added bonus, these shoes still come in non-neon colors which was becoming more difficult for me to find in the Asics lines"	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Triumph-ISO-Running/dp/B00YBBBW2E?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B010AHRG36&psc=1

Regarding product durability, I think it is too soon to have a verdict, though my experience with New Balance has been good in this regard, offering outstanding performance when it comes to wear resistance. The 2e or xw is this case is still a bit snug, but over time, it will stretch and later we will need to add corrected insole to get the arch support back. I don't wear them every day so a little early to judge this shoe but compared to the other shoes I have been trying this is built way better Fit as i expected...love them for walking really comfortable...want to get more.. Fresh Foam Vongo is somewhat stiff for my liking. The NB 860v8 was a better fit for my running style. However, the shoe still makes a great everyday shoe.

Conclusions:

These pull on and fit as comfy as a pair of heavy socks. Definitely lighter, with more flexible lower/mid, and far softer upper compared to the Instinct. This is probably the best shoe I have ever owned. And still haven't destroyed them. The shoe is just as good as the previous model but somehow feels even better. These are awesome. Super lightweight and very responsive. They definitely encourage a more natural running form. I would recommend transitioning into these to save your calves from utter destruction. (Ask me how i know....) The large toe box is a game changer. I would recommend using a locking lace to keep your heel securely in the show. Definitely a 5/5 shoe. All I can say is, wow. These shoes on the other hand tout their zero drop design. Unbelievably comfortable!. I will update this review when I hit the 6 month mark, but so far so good good sneaker but why so much lacing. So many of the manufactures put too much length in their lacing Wear these in warmer months as daily shoe. So comfortable and fit like a glove. A little pricey, but heck...the good stuff always is. The 1.5 is worth the price. Love these... but if you - like me - have never had zero drop kicks - there is a learning curve. Love the toebox and cush feel. Fit perfect and look great. Every run since has been great. I feel like these shoes have both increased my speed and my mileage. I love this color scheme (Green/blue). So far I would say I have put 100 miles on the shoes and they still look great (just a bit dirty). They are holding up well, top to bottom."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079JW8V3W/ref=asc_df_B079JW8V3W1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B079JW8V3W&linkCode=asn&psc=1

The quality has been consistently good across the generations of the model. The fit has been consistent across the generations as well. The shoe is one that will serve a lighter runner with relatively neutral biomechanics very well. The cushioning is good but a heavy runner may find that it will not stand up to the weight. All in all, the DS Trainer 22 is a good reliable and consistent shoe. The ASICS DS line has always been perfect and my go-to model for training and for competition. I was amazed how much the DS shoe has changed since 2004. Its lighter but every bit as comfortable as before. I have a mild pronation so I like a shoe that has some structural support. ASICS meets my need perfectly. How they managed to make a shoe that offers support and stability and feather light is amazing. I recommend this running shoe highly. Pros:
-Strong upper construction, feels very durable yet flexible in comparison to the knit material uppers that are very popular right now.
-Sole is ultra lightweight while still featuring Asics signature Gel cushioning and the support Asics support structure for stability
-My ankles are very prone to overpronation and I am a flat foot, the Asics tend to feel very stable and supportive on long runs and walks. When I run, I run on the balls of my feet and as they launch off the ground I usually get a nice roll off that feels springy, the Asics do not feel as springy. It's a great, well-cushioned neutral shoe for daily training. I chose size 12 per the Amazon recommendations and other reviewers, however it is still a bit too snug, especially if you wear them a while. Performance-wise, the shoes are great. Grip is good. They're light yet surprisingly well-cushioned, so prepare to feel quick on your feet. I've been able to increase my cadence and improve my overall running form in these. Overall, this shoe is a good mix of performance and comfort. Coming from the GT2000 series of ASICS I like these much better as they are lighter yet deliver excellent cushioning. The odd fit of the 22 series of DS Trainers is well-documented at this point, and for my second pair I went a full-size larger, as opposed to my normal half-size up for Asics (though they still feel narrow). Have to say this is my least favorite edition of the DS, and hope Asics doesn't repeat the mistakes of the 22. Just had to work the shoelaces differently, other than that the shoe is great for 5K road racing. Light, flexible and good traction which was what I was looking for"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-DS-Trainer-Running/dp/B01GSY5FEM?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N5IHLBJ&psc=1

You never know if they'll turn out to be good. At first the shoes seemed to have good correction for over-pronation, but before long, excess interior softness became evident, even so much as to pose a hazard when on stairs, compounded by the heels jutting so far back as to catch on rug edges (twice!).

The Gel Kayano 23 remains fabulous. I can't talk about whether the toe box is too small for some runners because I buy running shoes a full size larger than my street shoes, to guarantee that I never get the dreaded black toenail. The fit from side-to-side and front-to-back seemed perfect (not tight enough to be hot, not loose enough to slosh). I'd give the GK23 more than 5 stars if I could. [Retail: The GK23 arrived quickly, it was boxed like a new shoe, it seemed in perfect condition.] [Personal: I have the world's highest arch. I need the world's best cushioning.] [Model: I purchased the pure white GK23.

I started treating my feet better, to include wearing high quality shoes. These fit well and they are shaped in a way that works great with my foot. My friends have plenty of jokes, but the joke is on them because my feet feel better and I saved money by getting this color. They were both a size 10 and fit perfectly. And honestly.. I love the Kayano line. Not sure if theyre counterfeit or if its a defect... pretty sure this is on the seller though. Dont be afraid to say something if you get a pair thats too small. ? These are GREAT shoes. I have been a long-time ASICS guy, but these make me quite happy in two ways. First, with the exception of some tiny toe cramping in my right foot, they fit as expected for my size. Better yet - FINALLY - did I say FINALLY, after being a dedicated runner for 43 years, I have actually been able to buy a pair of running shoes that is not UGLY as sin. Other than that the fit was good and shoe was comfortable. Two toes too tight on top. Also don't feel as padded as I had hoped. But, the bed is nice and stiff, so that's good.

Happily the return policy is very good and I am returning them to exchange for a size 11.5. Hopefully I won't need a 12!. TBD.

Edit to Add: The 11.5 fit great and I really like the shoes. I'm a heavy runner that typically does 40-55 miles per week, and these are honestly some of the most lightest and comfortable shoes I've ever worn. They fit just right without feeling narrow and tight on the sides. You won't realize that they're even on your feet from being so light, yet the support is there. Saucony are funny, most are great, but some are not. Happy to say these restored my faith. Very comfortable, lots of support. Arch support is good. Like most people who buy ""running shoes"", I do not run. So i cannot say if they are good running shoes. For an everyday pair of sneakers, I love them. These are the best made running shoes for the money by far. They are no frills but feel more comfortable and cushioned than any other brand. I was surprised w how lightweight and supportive this shoe is. It's a neutral shoe but it provides great arch support( I have a medium arch). But lately it has been doing double duty as an around the house shoe because its lightweight & comfortable. I wear an 11.5 and the fit was good, w a thumb space at the toe. When I mentioned the free return I was told that, ""The return shipping cost is listed in the details (meaning, ""the fine print""). Please beware. I have been a Brooks fan for a while, but found some Cohesion 9 shoes on sale and figured, for this price, why not. Well, they were the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Well, they are just as comfortable and light weight. Very happy with them. It's amazing what the right pair of shoes can do for you, and these are the right pair for me. This is a very good running shoe. The shoes are light weight, flexible, well ventilated and shock absorbent. The soles don't look worn, so I guess someone returned them after trying them on. Yes, they do run small. Con: zero arch support and very little cushioning. If you can get them on a good sale, they are worth it for me since I always put inserts in my running shoes."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HOAD0V4/ref=asc_df_B01HOAD0V45865861?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01HOAD0V4&linkCode=asn&psc=1

They're comfortable. I never had this issue with original 1260s. The original 1260 are laced fully up and I still have plenty of lace left. They stay tied (so far) on my runs, but how much money do you save by shortening the laces?. Even the achilles heel padding on the original 1260 have a notch to allow for the tendon, these new ones don't. It seems like a nicer finish to have the notch in the padding. Is it worth alienating a runner who is a loyal NB customer. Read more I am 245lbs and run about 15-20 miles per week and these are a significant improvement over the 1260 V6. I do have a 1260V5 (orange) which I like and hate to retire because they were my favorite I think of all the versions in the series. When I order my normal size I get them in 4E or I can order them a half size larger and can get the 2E, which is more popular. I liked the version 7 so much that after one 60 min run, I ordered another pair. Good improvement New Balance, I have been with the 1260's since they started. Depending on brand and shoe type my shoe size ranges from a 11 4E to a 12.5 2E, hence the challenge of ordering shoes online. Having said that and after reading the reviews I decided to go a half size up (12.5 2E) and tried them on immediately to ensure a proper fit. These shoes are quite possibly the most comfortable Ive ever worn. The shoes are very soft and comfortable, but they are a bit too narrow. Because of this, I went with a 2E, which fits perfectly in the foot, but is wide in the ankle. Was super disappointed with the v7s. I've never had foot pain with ANY running shoe, but after 3-4 runs with these the pain on my right foot was unbearable. Hopefully NB comes out with a v8 soon that is in line with the shoe's heritage. Anyone want a pair of v7s 11.5s with less than 20 miles on them. Joking but not really Feels softer and more stable than the previous very comfortable platform. More bridge support and more side ways movement stabilization much like a volleyball or real tennis shoe now in a running shoe. Good upgrade, I recommend
Colors are good with me. I am a devoted New Balance customer and will continue to be. The 1260V7 is a great shoe. The fit is supportive yet comfortable; stylish and all the right colors I love. Have tried various non-custom orthotics recommended by my podiatrist. These 1250v7 shoes are amazing. The support is fantastic and for the first time in a long time, I have no pain. Not until wearing these shoes did I realize how different a cheap foam shoe is to a well built supportive shoe like these are."	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Mens-1260V7-Running/dp/B01NBA2JVU?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N0IG6IS&psc=1

They are awesome in every way but one. It was not noticeable at first, but after walking and then running on my treadmill it was clear that extra material inside the shoe would cause a blister. I also bought the Wave Creation and those do not have that issue at all. Keeping the Wave Creation 19. Hope this helps. I have owned three earlier Wave Prophecy with only positive results. I have worn the Wave 7 for three workouts and it is giving me blisters on top of my feet. Not only can I no longer ware them but I am out a substantial amount of money because of the Amazon return policy. I own the Prophecy 6 and for sure the 7 is more comfortable on hard surfaces. There is tightness in the fit that other reviewers have alluded to. Its a very smart shoe. Its awesome. The high visibility safety features are so advanced that there is nothing like them on the market. They glow in low light in a very cool way. awesome for that feature. A great pair of running shoes. They're very comfortable and provide copious support when you need it most. Great shoes for a wide foot and heavy runner. Add some heavy duty Thorlo XLs and you should be good to go the distance. I buy a new pair every year for a hilly half marathon I jog, only to make sure I have the most possible cushion. A++ foot care for a heavy runner. I started out and bought the wave creation 19 last year on prime deals 10 1/2. They fit fine might have been just a bit snug in the width but are actually still very comfortable. I wanted another pair because since I was a kid you always have to have one pair set aside for good right. Anyway, i purchased at least 2 other pairs of wave creation 19/20's and they were all way too slim and sent them back. So I finally upped to size 11 and they fit very similar to the original wave create 19 pair except they are just a bit longer. It's not very noticeable and my foot is certainly not sliding around. The shoes are great once you figure out the sizing. But I do like the way the prophecy 7's feel. They still fit great but was nervous to keep such expensive shoes with visible quality issues. They are well made and good running shoes.

I love these shoes. I keep coming back to ASICS, and this particular model as being my favorite running shoes. I dont want a clunky, stiff shoe. These shoes fit that bill. Comfort wise, I find they feel slipper-like. My feet feel great as I run. The fabric on the inside is soft and gentle. The soles have ample support to carry my above average body weight (200lbs) without being stiff. In terms of durability, I find they hold up better that most of my shoes. Still, like any running shoe I do replace them regularly. There is a version of these shoes without the cut outs, but I prefer the light weight. Simply I have been thru my share of mostly expensive running sneakers in the last 3-4 months. I chose these Asics to be honest, mostly on their looks.to be my every day walk around SOMETIMES running shoes. What I was not expecting was how great looking they look in person, how COMFORTABLE they actually are and very light. For the price these sneakers WAY OVER deliver on quality....I LOVE these running shoes...more than I thought I would. Great pair of sneakers..LOOKS great too. Not only is this shoe super comfortable and light, it also is one of the rare running shoes that actually looks good enough to wear casually. With the shoe industry churning out new models ever year, whenever I find a shoe I actually like I can never find it again when I need a new pair. I wish there were more shoes like these out there, but at least I should be set for a while. They work, but theyre more for walking or very casual running. Also, the toe box is a tad small, but it is not terrible. These are good looking shoes for everyday comfortable wear. I always order the same size in Asics and they have always fit. The most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, I wear nothing but asics and these truly cushion and support my feet well. I was a bit skeptical at first because I usually wear a wide shoe but these take on my shape so good, I will be buying another pair when these bite the dust (no time soon ) and I wear these everyday Terrible in the wet - there is so little contact area that when you walk in the wet your feet keep slipping	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Fuzex-Lyte-Running/dp/B01GU4DZY2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N9KOONI&psc=1

These are very comfortable shoes and I don't even want to add gel-insoles, these shoes don't need them. Wear all day and feet feel great. Well fitting and comfortable shoe that is ever so slightly wider than most other asics I've worn.

...Except for one problem. I haven't been doing anything strenuous or intense with these shoes so I expected them to last longer. I'll update this if the issue is resolved. Excellent shoes. Going to a wider size resulted in a sloppy fit. I would recommend these shoes. They're basically the only brand that makes shoes my body likes. Kind of felt like both outer edges were really built up creating a canyon in the middle that just doesn't work. Usually new shoes have a nice spring to them. Heck, my flip-flops feel livelier. The cushion was also so hard that aside from the thin foam insole it felt about like being barefoot on concrete. On the good side they look beautiful and do appear to have better/more durable construction of the uppers than some of the Altras I've gotten in the past. I like the way they fit, I bought a half size up from my normal shoe size, which is typical for me when buying Altras, so no big deal there. I liked the sleek feel, sort of a racer like feel and I thought they would be great when running. These shoes did not work for me and I will not be trying another version of it, but they may be good for someone who needs stiff stability. I love that Altra has a very wide toe box. I use these as my nursing shoes because they are well padded, which I need for 12 hrs on my feet. This is my new favorite Altra shoe. I loved their Instinct model, but I needed more support for my over-pronation. They're both great, and I'm able to enjoy running without my knees and feet hurting. Sizing moving from the Instinct to Provision was about a 1/2 step up - I had a 9.5 Instinct which was just a bit too big, and the 9.5 Provision fits perfectly. I like them but. Altra Men's 3.0 look great and I like the concept of Zero Drop. They feel light on my feet and makes me feel like I want to run. They feel much better but stiffer and heavier.

Dual density midsole']	"Theyre just as good as the v1 and v2, both of which I also continue to run in. While I wouldnt wear any Zante for a full marathon (Id prefer more cushion for that distance), the v3 is perfect for a half  light, speedy, flexible, medium cushion and nice fit (I wear a 10 wide). Most important, theyre just plain fun for running. The upper differs from that of the v1 and v2, but not in a bad way. Actually, I enjoy all of the Zante versions. Runners World awarded them its Editors Choice award for a good reason. I like the Zante V3 quite a bit- and I'm returning it unused. The heel collar (that's the open part of the shoe that goes from the top lace eyelets to the back) has a ridge right at the top outside front that juts up and presses into my extensor, right where the top of the foot and bottom of the leg merge. It was a drag, because I really liked them otherwise. The toebox, although it was narrow, had a good amount of stretch and wiggle room; the sole had the right amount of support and firmness; they were light and flexible. Again, I really liked these, but for that little sticky-out bit. I have had both knees replaced, so I have bought several pairs of New Balance Fresh Foam 1080 V7 shoes on the advice of my orthopedic surgeon who wears them every day. I have been very satisfied with those shoes, but these Fresh Foam Zante V3 shoes not so much. Comparing the two shoes, the Zante's Fresh Foam cushioning is not quite equal to the 1080's but it isn't bad. I rotate pairs of shoes and the Zante is in the rotation, but they just don't feel quite as comfortable as the Fresh Foam 1080s. I will buy more Fresh Foam 1080s. I wore size 12 in V1 and that was perfect. size 12, V3 feels 1/2 size too short.

2) The V3 feels STIFF and clunky. It is no where near as soft and forgiving as V1. The outsole has held up well and seems very durable however, the shoe is so different from V1 that I wouldn't take the risk of buying another Zante. What works well for me may not work well for another. I am in LOVE with these new balance shoes. They are lightweight and responsive. I can feel the road but remain comfortably cushioned. I really love these shoes. As with the V2, these shoes are comfortable right out of the box. The sole is soft enough to be comfortable and still provide good feedback from the road. The show looks good and feels good, but the heel cushioning is not as good as the M890s. The fit is fine, maybe slightly small"	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FSDLA0W/ref=asc_df_B01FSDLA0W1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01FSDLA0W&linkCode=asn&psc=1

I plan on reordering a size 10.5 or 11 because they are exactly what I'm looking for, and I can tell they're good running shoes. These are a great looking shoe, comfortable, and lightweight. However, I highly recommend ordering a half size up. I have owned two other under armour shoes and they were true to size. Was skeptical at 1st ,absolutley love the color's as blue is my favorite. They looked thin and cheap but I gave it a shot and I am so glad I did. These shoes are some of best and most comfortable shoe's I own. I have alot of shoes some are over 125.00 and these are more comfortable. I have to tell you these fit perfect plus my right shoe. I have a insole I have to wear.I highly recommend these shoes and Definitly will wear and buy more of this style. Thank's I really like these shoes. They have good support and help with my plantar fasciitis. Definitely worth the price though. The shoe would be fine if they could fix the heel. I bought a 1/2 size larger and it fits great. Been testing them out on the treadmill and so far so good. I don't even wear socks and they feel fine. Good fit but go easy with them at the beginning... had huge blister on back of foot on first use. I got these shoes for my boyfriend & he loves them.

The Gel Kayano 23 remains fabulous. I can't talk about whether the toe box is too small for some runners because I buy running shoes a full size larger than my street shoes, to guarantee that I never get the dreaded black toenail. The fit from side-to-side and front-to-back seemed perfect (not tight enough to be hot, not loose enough to slosh). I'd give the GK23 more than 5 stars if I could. [Retail: The GK23 arrived quickly, it was boxed like a new shoe, it seemed in perfect condition.] [Personal: I have the world's highest arch. I need the world's best cushioning.] [Model: I purchased the pure white GK23. I like that the GK23 does not have a black sole that can leave dirt-like rubber filings on the wife's carpets and hardwoods. She's happy too.] I have suffered from plantar fasciitis in the past. I started treating my feet better, to include wearing high quality shoes. These fit well and they are shaped in a way that works great with my foot. My friends have plenty of jokes, but the joke is on them because my feet feel better and I saved money by getting this color. They were both a size 10 and fit perfectly. And honestly.. I love the Kayano line. Not sure if theyre counterfeit or if its a defect... pretty sure this is on the seller though. Dont be afraid to say something if you get a pair thats too small. ? These are GREAT shoes. I have been a long-time ASICS guy, but these make me quite happy in two ways. First, with the exception of some tiny toe cramping in my right foot, they fit as expected for my size. Better yet - FINALLY - did I say FINALLY, after being a dedicated runner for 43 years, I have actually been able to buy a pair of running shoes that is not UGLY as sin. Other than that the fit was good and shoe was comfortable. Two toes too tight on top. Also don't feel as padded as I had hoped. But, the bed is nice and stiff, so that's good.

I have played around with different insoles and have not gotten these shoes to work for me.....yet. The thing is you have to have a low profile insole, nothing too thick because there is not a lot of room in the forefoot area, height wise in these shoes. The Everun insole is pretty thin and there is not much too it. Glad I didn't. I had to spread the laces wider than I'm used to and they were initially tight to get on over my heels, but once adjusted they were supportive rather than tight. I half expected to have sore feet after just a half mile and had the old shoes ready but these were fine. Most reviews recommend 1/2 size larger - that would have been too small for me and my toes would have screamed before starting. I went a full size larger and could not have worn any smaller - my toes are all the way to the front. With that adjustment I am quite happy with fit and comfort. Maybe just a fluke, but went back to using my old pair (Guide 7 model, which have over 300 miles) - that were the same ""size"" but fit me right and still have a good solid tread on them. I'll likely go to my local running store next time to get a proper fit and recommendations. I've had Saucony Guides since the Guide 5 when they were recommended by a salesperson at a running store. I have always had good results with these and have stuck with them since originally finding them. Some owners have claimed changes in fit over the years. That may be true, but I think they have been subtle at best and still find them to be the best sneaker for me. The Guide 10 is my new running shoe, the Guide 9 is retired to my daily use, and the Guide 8 is the new mowing shoe. 5, 6 and 7 have since been put out to pasture where all great sneakers eventually wind up. As a 20 year runner, Saucony is typically a quality trainer brand for me, at a decent price, with a bright color options for me; however, 80 Miles in, one shoe had treads that began peeling off and flapping around. Id still buy again, but start using them closer to my purchase date so as to have a stronger case with customer service. In my opinion as a Saucony customer for almost 40 years they might produce the most under appreciated and affordable running shoes. Under appreciated perhaps because as customers we don't have to pay for a huge advertising budget. The Guide 10, like most Saucony running shoes is light, flexible and remarkably affordable. Saucony still makes my favorite running shoes. Then things get better but even though I havent gone beyond 5 miles with them I just dont see them as marathon material just yet. The rest is just fine. Great looks, good lacing, good stability and fair cushioning. Great shoe! low amount of over-pronation support, quite stiff (compared to the iso hurricane) good traction. good lacing. I really like the design and colors. ran 100km in them, it took a very long period to brake-in, about 40-50km - but once they did they are great. size is true compared to other Saucony shoes, to brooks, Nike and NB. in some brands I take 2e, with this one d works. glad I bought it, one of my favorites."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Guide-Running-Shoes/dp/B01MY0V5UY?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N1ZPZV6&psc=1

Despite being tall and built like a Beast myself, my size 16 EE feet loved running in the Brooks Beasts for years. This $160 shoe felt like a $20 discount store sneaker. It seemed like my unattractive Beasts with Grandpa-style design was trying to look cool but at the expense of comfort. It felt like I had a sharp knife in each of my shoes. Bruised blisters on each foot approximately six inches in length; the marks matched up perfectly with the inside edge of the outsole. Amazon is amazing, however. I returned them for a full refund, but I also lost all hope for Brooks. Read more i owned beast 16, this beast 18 is better in width, cushioning, material wise as will, first time i bought the 16s it was a bit narrow and with time it adjusted to my feet, but with 18 its more comfortable widths in the toes area especial, i recommend this if you are huge person 6.2 FT+, and wight more than 250 pounds with WIDE FLAT FEET, this is the best motion control shoes with Maximum stability and Ultimate comfort shoes you can get. I was a huge fan of The Brooks Beast 14 and then had to go to another shoe when the 16 came out. I wear custom orthotics and loved the style and fit of the Beast 14. The bottom felt like it had no padding and the built in support felt more restrictive than helpful. I found the laces short as always with them and the full mesh upper made getting a fit that felt fully secure and comfortable very hard. Good: They look ok. Pleanty of heal support and cushion. Not enough arch support for my liking. I can now throw out my NB 860v8 knowing I finally have the perfect shoe for my foot in size 13EE. Thank you Brooks. I've done 2 runs a 5k and a 10k with this Beast 18s and I'm immediately feeling a positive improvement from the New Balance m940 v3 that I was using before. I was a fan of the Beast 14 and it's good to see the Brooks Beast return to its former glory with this new Brooks Beast 18. I kind of wish it stung a little less in the wallet but if this is what it takes to protect me from the wear on my knees, shins and ankles from pounding the pavement, so be it. Amazing improvement over the Brooks Beast 16. Not only does it fit better with a generous toe box, but it has many quality improvements in materials and cushioning.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077T1974N/ref=asc_df_B077T1974N1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B077T1974N&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Two months ago my dream man just packed up and left our home one day while I was at work, without notice. Although I'm embarking on a lengthy and life changing journey of learning what this means and how to adore myself, I knew that Amazon was always standing by to pick up the pieces. So after more time I found a shred of strength and ordered these shoes. After all, I was envisioning my new and vibrant life. I figured now was as good as a time as any to take a page out of his book and start running away from things. Today, after I saw the UPS guy punt the box from the curb (fairly impressive), I felt a sense of relief as I went to retrieve them from the snow drift he had inadvertently buried them in. I opened the package and slipped them on and they were a dream. Light as a feather and a perfect fit (order at least a half size larger than your own size). Just me, these amazing and magical feeling shoes, 13 different emotions, and the prophetic poetry of Eminem pushing me around on that indoor track, ""Success is my only mother****ing option, failure's not."" So if you're looking for your moment...your do-over...your time to sparkle...your victory song...these shoes should DEFINITELY be part of your arsenal. Let them be symbolic in finding yourself again...you won't regret the purchase. Read more First off, I'm not a runner--not even close--I'm a fat, 43-year-old woman that wanted a lightweight, comfy shoe that didn't make me look like I was 80 to wear on a trip to Italy in a few weeks. These are comfy out of the box and really flexible. As for the material, I live in Florida and do plan to wear these after my trip, and I think the lightweight mesh fabric across the top will work well in our heat. Honestly, though, I bought these largely based on style. I love the purple, but they don't scream THAT LADY'S WEARING PURPLE SHOES. There's enough gray in the fabric to tone them down. Ultimately, it's just a cute, comfy shoe and I'd buy them again. I absolutely love these shoes. They are super light weight, and extremely comfortable. I got them to workout in, but after trying them on, they'll certainly be my everyday shoe when I run errands, etc. - and want that extra comfort. I got my regular size that I always wear 7.5 and they fit me perfect. I can wear them with, or without socks and they still fit great. I highly recommend these shoes, if you're looking for style, and comfort. This is a very light, well made shoe. The soles are very supportive, responsive, & flexible while providing comfortable arch support. The knit body breathes exceptionally well & makes wearing these shoes w/o any socks very comfortable & w/o causing your feet to sweat or stink. The insoles are removable & washable which is a nice feature. Wearing this shoe is almost like wearing a comfortable sock w/ a sole. One caveat - - if you have wide feet, these shoes can be a little tight across the top of your foot. You may need to size up, or at least open the lacing up a good bit. I LOVE these shoes. I have really high arches - so the amount of arch support that this shoe has fits me quite well. Love the color and was quick to arrive. Awesome shoes, Im a big fan of Nike frees. I will say they fit about one full size small. Itll be fine once I break them in a bit, or at least thats what Im hoping for. All in all, these are awesome looking shoes and the material is very light and breathable. Most comfortable pair of running shoes Ive ever owned!. Super cute too!. Fit perfectly!. Broad toe-box are perfect for my regular width feet (I need a roomy toebox for pain in my big toes and these fit the bill). I have high arches & dont need to use inserts with these...so Id have to say this should would be wonderful for anyone who needs excellent arch support!. These sneaks are the most lightweight Ive ever owned and its an awesome feeling when jogging!. Not too heavy on the ankles and mesh keep my normally super hot feet relatively cool!. Im super impressed with these running shoes!!"	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Mens-Free-Flyknit-Running/dp/B000ARCMA4?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B071P9842Y&psc=1

I do a lot of walking, 5 to 10 miles a day, and these shoes are super comfortable and were great right out the box. I ordered a half size up based on the previous reviews and am happy I did. I'm also happy with the width. These are my first pair of Adidas so I was fearful their idea of wide would be a joke, like some other brands. I bought some special tape to try and prevent the hole from getting any bigger but who knows how long that fix will last. I used winter socks for a while to expand them. I bought a number higher than usually I get from Sketchers or Nike. The walk is soft and really nice, I haven't run with them but I guess it would be good. The air circulation is pretty good which helps in keeping your feet fresh while playing. Initially tried them on and the top of the back of the heel pushed down and in. I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. He is a size 13 wide and surprisingly, he said it's very comfortable. It lets his feet breathe, gives him good support, and it's wide enough to where he doesn't feel cramped in it. It works out well for him and he uses it mostly at the gym. I bought these shoes for my hubby and he loves them. He's all about comfort and they met his expectation. He has a very wide and flat foot and has the hardest time finding a shoe that fits him well. I only wish they had other colors in the same 4E size. Everything about the shoe seems ok, except the middle part of the shoe. I have a wide foot and the area around my ankle and widest part of my foot fit great. I can't put my foot in the shoes again without it hurting. Very comfortable. Easy to wear, and fits right in with blue jeans or workout shorts. Probably will buy again, simply because it fits my foot so well. Just know that you will wear down the rubber pretty fast, then you on at the foam.

They're that good. I'm not too crazy how they look but running without pain is more important to me. My experience with them is they are true to size and consistent in size from model to model and between versions of the same model. That is not to say they all fit the same, but simply that a 10, is a 10 is a 10. I have run in Riders, Inspire, Sayonara, Paradox and first version of Catalyst. All had the typical Mizuno firmness and all feel like I expected. I like wider for longer runs. Good thing. It's wonderfully Mizuno and with a lower drop than the Inspire, still with excellent lightweight support. I have three of them in rotation and they do loosen up, but I need very thin socks and loose laces over the forefoot with the lock loop on top for a comfortable long-run fit. They are as wide in the toe box as my Inspire 11s. This is a good change. Next run will be with my normal Experia socks, I expect it to be perfect. I have to say - these are really good. I got them as an alternative to my usual running shoes and am glad I did. Not to mention the price is great versus similar offerings from the big name brands. The Mizuno Running Shoes seem to feel the best and are a great value. I average 20,000 steps per day so I go through a lot of running shoes.. . the Mizuno also seem to wear well and last a bit longer. After doing some research, these were recommended for people with flat feet, so I thought I'd get them. Glad I did.....husband loves them and the color. I am the 'perfect' size 10, but the Wave Catalyst 2 in 10 was huge. These fit, but they still feel a little awkward. The good news is that these are still phenomenal running shoes. I love Mizunos. Not sure what's going on with their sizing, but if you find a pair that fit, your feet will be very happy. These shoes felt amazing from the first minute I put them on. My workouts felt so much better. I honestly didn't mind the color combination. This is all about comfort though. Two year *UPDATE* Originally a 5 because the week I first got them they felt great and look even better. As a personal trainer I am very active but these just didnt hold up the way I would have liked. Having purchased two now, the thing I notice with them is that the red rubber on the sole will separate from the white rubber faster than I would have liked. Additionally, the mesh like fabrics near the pinky toe didnt accommodate my wide feet so that area wore faster. Overall these are solid shoes and great to train in. But for the price Im sure there are better and more specific shoes you can buy that will better suit your needs. The style however is definitely still top notch.

First Adidas Boost shoes i've ever worn, very pleasantly surprised. I've owned quite a few pairs of the Reebok Hexaffect shoes, and Nike Flex Run, and these beat them all so far in comfort. Quality seems to be very well, will update if anything changes. However, so far, they are by far my favorite go to shoes. Highly recommend picking up a pair, the look and feel great. My old Adidas Boosts were getting old and I was in the market for new running shoes. I tried on a bunch of shoes at my local running shoes store, and I fell in love with these when I tried them on. These are similar to Nike Frees in that the upper is of mesh material that hugs you like socks, but I found these to be less tight than Nikes. The soles feel rather thin, but I can certainly feel the springiness of the Boost material even at this thickness. These feel lighter than any other running shoes I have worn and my runs with these have been quite fantastic. I usually wear 9 or 9.5, but I found 8 to be the perfect fit for these. They felt a little snug at first, but as I broke into the shoes, the upper stretched a bit and are just magnificent now. I highly recommend these to any runner. Crazy light, comfortable, and breathable. Great shoes but they may be a bit fragile. Very happy with quality, fit, and finish. Found these shoes to provide excellent cushioning for both running and leisurely strolls. Shoes are both aesthetically appealing and functional -- the uppers are excellently designed and are breathable. Plus, the reflectorized uppers are a safety feature when running at night. Further, my foot feels secure and well supported. And, the Continental co-branding makes for sturdy outsoles that do not wear out easily. adidas Performance adizero Prime LTD Running Shoe,Black/White/Black,11 M US Great shoe. I got the 'black' one, but it looks more like a dark navy blue. I don't mind the color, but just be aware of that fact.

4.5/5 Incredibly light and comfortable yet still well cushioned by the boost soles I bought my second pair after ~300 road miles. Having said all that, fastest and most comfortable shoe I own from 5k to half marathon. The retired pair is now my most comfortable park/dog walking shoe as well. They run a little bit small and feel less cushioning than adios 3 that I love. Not the best adidas shoes Ive had but not bad overall."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-adizero-prime-ltd-U-Adizero/dp/B0119E20HG?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0119D6FSM&psc=1

My search may have been a bit unique in that was looking for a very flexible tennis shoe that was goretex and to my surprise there werent a lot in that note a lot of the goretex shoes out there are hiking shoes. Running shoes work much better. And these shoes are pretty cool not only are they lightweight they are in fact lighter than my Nike Pegasus. So the toe on these are covered in a waterproof shiny black coating which Im sure is durable and really makes the shoe waterproof. But one thing totally surprised me, the toungue on these shoes is not goretex, and in fact is not waterproof rather it is like a neoprene that has holes in it. I mean Im fine with that and in fact sorta like it, just it will reduce the waterproofness. I mean maybe Ill end up liking these better, I have put them through their paces with some extreme rain and they worked great. I mean I was on concrete but it has been extremely rainy and I was happy. Even with the puddle my one foot got a bit wet but because overall the shoe is so good my feet were happy and I had a good outing. Anyway overall these are pretty cool well made waterproof running shoes. The fabric inside and outside is intact. There is always benefit of doubt but I'm not ever paying $100 to tried Adidas GTX again. That said, they've broken in a bit and are pretty comfortable now, and are great at what they do i.e. keep my feet dry in wet conditions. These things are indestructible and 100% waterproof. I LOVE these shoes. I work outside parking cars and the Adidas Outdoor Mens Terrex CMTK GTX Shoe is awesome. The tread has been strong, the shoe is light, but concrete will wear the bottom down eventually. Super excited to have these. These are probably the most comfortable shoes Ive owned. I wear a different pare of shoes for indoor work than outdoor, and wish they made these exact shoes minus the rubber cletes for indoor. These are absolutely beautiful shoes..I enjoy the details put into..I especially like the gore tex material...these are great for rain filled days..the grip these shoes have are top of the line...so far I've had them about a week..and no disappointments..I highly recommend Very nice looking running shoes. Much better than most less than $150 Adidas shoes, while not too colorful. My husband likes it, but only wear it on rainy days, lol.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-outdoor-Mens-Terrex-CMTK/dp/B078WFJXH9?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075KTXP6B&psc=1
295	25	Nike Revolution 3	['Mesh/Phylon Foam', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Mesh upper for optimal breathability', 'Soft foam midsole delivers lightweight, responsive cushioning', 'Rubber outsole offers excellent traction']	I put over 400 miles on the last pair in less than a year, and they look like when I bought them. I like them a lot and am not normally a Nike fan, rather New Balance. These seem more durable and better runners. Nice and light weight. Perfect if you have knee issues and don't need to have the extra weight when you walk. I think they fit good on me. One thing I did not think was as good as usual was the insole support. The shoe strings are regular thin shoe strings like you would find on a men's dress shoe... All said the shoes are nice but not NIKE's usual quality and a bit over priced when taking quality into consideration. I love these shoes. This version has a good sole. These are very comfortable, they fit as expected and aren't too narrow. I don't know how to describe the comfort except to say I don't even notice them, so they certainly aren't uncomfortable. Too be fair, they are just shoes, and they breathe really well, but they are not even slightly water proof. Usually a pair like this only last me a year, so I wish they were not $60, especially in my size (13), especially since they are an older version, on Amazon, and they don't last very long. I guess you have to sacrifice some durability for the comfort factor. Of course the red tennis shows look great so if that's what you need, go for it - just don't try to run in them or wear them for more than 1 hour. Excellent fitting shoe. One of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I have owned. Fit exactly as expected. Great arch support and very breathable. Love them. These are nice shoes with some minor modifications. They look good, and they're reasonably sturdy, mostly. The insoles and laces the shoes come with are thin, cheap, and feel like they'll wear out quickly. If you replace them though it also makes the shoes a lot more comfortable. I get the impression that these shoes were manufactured to fit a particular price range, so some compromises were made to keep costs down. Still, at least the cheap bits are easily, and commonly, replaced. So i bought these since i was in need of running shoes and wore the nike's rev 1 and remeber then being comfortable. I wear Vans and flat footed shoes alot and running kinda bothered my foot a bit but these shoes changed that very comfy and feel great on my feet even for long periods of time If you need something affordable and dont wanna buy over priced shoes but need something that can keep up with your daily workouts i higly reccomend these reason why it a 4 not a 5 its a little hard to clean these since the openings on the shoes make it easy for water to get in so avoid puddles	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3P0WOZ/ref=asc_df_B01N3P0WOZ1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01N3P0WOZ&linkCode=asn&psc=1

These shoes are a dream. They air lightweight, breathable, easy slip on, no tie, with a solid amount of cushion in the sole.

I love the brand, but these shoes are poorly designed. This is my second pair in a row of this model of Nike, and one of my favorite distance running shoes I've ever had. I run long distances (half and full marathons) and these are the right amount of support without being too firm, and are very cushiony and comfortable. It annoyed me quite a bit at first but the shoes feel so good on runs that I learned to live with it. Small price to pay for the benefits and comfort of these sneaks. I love the color and the fit is perfect!. Most of all, I love the fact that the shoe is made all in one piece...there is no tongue and as I am not able to bend over & put my own shoes on (fused spine), these shoes are just perfect-in every way. I have tried several different sneakers for jumping rope as well as running, speed walking, and CrossFit. No contest these are hands down the most comfortable and they have a great bounce due to the sole construction. I developed shin splints theee weeks back due to an inferior pair of nikes but Ill most definitely be ordering these again. These came recommended from the zen dudes aka jump rope dudes. They run true to size as well. I loved them so much because of their low impact on the bottom of my feet that I wore them out. I was a little leery at first but once I got them on they were just as good as my old pair. I recommend these for anyone who works retail and can wear sneakers, anyone looking for a low impact sole, and anyone who has a case of plantars.

By sizing up the toe box had plenty of room and great protection. They provide good stability. They have exceeded my expectations which were pretty high already considering the number of rave reviews they get. Finding gaiters that work, fit and last is a big challenge. Great pair of hiking shoes. Wore them straight out of the box and went on two 8 mile hikes on very rocky, dry, loose and sometimes steep terrain and the shoes grip very well. ASICS and Merrells I am good with a size 11. I ordered these shoes in an 11.5 and the fit is great. The toe box provides good protection, and the sole provides excellent traction on dirt (especially downhills). I normally wear a US 12, and the size 46 fits me perfectly. Wonderful shoes for hiking. Great traction through the entire trip and they dried quickly after they got wet. I found that a combination of these shoes and neoprene socks (for diving) kept my feet fairly warm and dried out quickly post Narrows hike. Definitely would buy again. One of the nicest lookin pair out of all my running, trail and cross training shoes. Was very happy to order a 46 even though I wear a size 11.5; always go half or full size up on these 'European' shoes if you usually shop US sizes. The shoe is comfortable and protects the foot well in rocky environments. The outsole is decently sticky and stable, although you can't expect miracles (to state the obvious: you will still slide when running on rocks covered in mud). I've become a fan of La Sportiva Trail running shoes, since 2011 when I bough my first pair of Wildcats. Every change has been for better. Definitely one size up works better in my case because in long distance running my feet normally swell a little.

Best shoes ever, they look very well made and comfy, I had to return it, the only reason writing this review is to let the new buyers know that it runs one size big !!. This shoe though, after 118 miles suddenly began feeling oddly large on the left foot. Up until this point I have been pleased with them. They have been a great shoe for non-technical terrain. I would recommend these to others, and believe they are most well suited for manicured trails absent of mud, water, or other slippery terrain. Until the sudden stretch, they have been an excellent trail shoe that was comfortable for trail runs in excess of 2 hours. Colors are like the pictures, and the fit it is as I thought so. Perfect product for people looking for more comfort in technique terrains	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-L40676700-US-8-0-UK-7-5/dp/B07CYYJQL8?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07FMQK352&psc=1

309	9	Altra Olympus 3.0	['Mesh-Synthetic', 'Imported', 'More breathable and durable upper', 'More flexible midsole due to the addition of InnerFlex', 'Widened heel and outsole groove for stability and traction', 'Stack Height: 33mm', 'Cushioning: Max']	They are similar to my Timp's....Not sure why they took away the cushioning level.. I have the need to wear arch supports, so that was something I had to consider. Because of my arches, I wanted something to help as much as possible with the impact of running and after running in these twice now, I have to say these are awesome. Yesterday I forgot to put my arch supports in and was not able to go back and get them, but I ran anyways. My feet did not hurt at all. Now don't get me wrong, these shoes do not have much of a built in arch support. But the cushioning was good enough to save me. I'm not going to try that again, but it was nice to know that the major padding on the bottom of these shoes was able to save me when I forgot my arch supports. That's a big bonus and honestly the thing I was most worried about when I decided I need to start running. I am amazed!. The toe box is great and Im not rolling around in them when tired. The booklet that comes with the shoe indicates that you should transition slowly from your old shoes to your Altras, I disagree, run in a pair of shoes that are comfortable, light and fast (for me). I added Protalus M100 orthopedic inserts to these amazing shoes and absolutely love the results. I weigh over 250 pounds and I love to trail run on difficult trails. I am confident the shoes protect my feet and joints and I can concentrate on getting faster and more agile. This shoe will add many healthy years to my running. Worth every penny. This shoe seems faster and more responsive than the Olympus 2.0. I hope they last but honestly I will be buying this shoe again no matter what. It just feels that good. Running on trails is a dream. I usually have issues with blistering on my front inner arch after a rough 50+ mile weeks but I dont even have irritation in that area 50 miles into my first week. They are damn ugly but who cares?!?. I love Altra BUT the last two pair of Olympus I have run in have less than desirable durability. Bought Olympus 2.0 and 2.5... and really liked them. It has similar cushion, but also has a firm structure underneath when pressed, for extra support. I don't immediately hate it or love it... i will have to wear them for a while and edit this. Very happy.	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-AFM1859F-Olympus-Trail-Running/dp/B079R7SN9B?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07C2MJ5NR&psc=1

Yes the color is not as shown, it looks orange in the images, but its really a salmon colored pink. I would definitely buy another pair after I retire these. Great running shoes. Very comfy and provide good support. This is my first time on the adidas boost soles and they ride great. Super comfortable and noticeable energy return. the uppers are seemless with decent room in the toebox. I'm happy to find these and recommend as a quality road shoe. Id bought a pair of these Runners a couple of years ago and decided that Id like to replace them like for like. Purchasing the trainer was easy via Amazon.com and the delivery was as expected. However the trainer did not live up to my expectations and was slightly different to the original trainer that I still had and used for comparison. The most noticeable difference was the toe box, it was much tighter than my original Adistar trainer making the trainer un wearable, there was also less support around the ankle and heal as the trainer had a reduced profile. These trainers are now in flying back to the US and I shall be going to my local running store for a shoe fit. Shoes are great. People with 2E or wider feet, skip Adidas products entirely, you will not get them to fit. Nicely cushioned and supportive but feels small for the size. I've been wearing Boost for the past couple of years because of comfort. I was having problems with pain after working on my feet all day but Boost has cured me. Great shoe again from Adidas.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Adistar-Boost-ESM/dp/B00X1C1VSY?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073GSGS7P&psc=1

I've been a loyal adidas customer for years, and when it comes to shoes, they seem to work for me the best when it comes to comfort, durability, and style. Very often, they are also a better choice for a price-conscientious consumer without sacrificing one bit of quality. These are excellent running shoes, hands down. For an active, regular runner, one feature is hard to miss and very easy to appreciate. This means a very comfortable fit even with the lightest, thinnest socks. Overall, the soles provide adequate cushioning to prevent injuries. I typically run on asphalt and the soles resist wear and seem to be very durable as well. Hihgly recommended. Top fabric also softer, but the sole is so great. Great for my knees These might be the best shows I've ever had. And I usually wear good shoes like brooks. Awesome. Perhaps it's just my foot, but these fit absolutely perfectly. No extra toe room, just perfect. They feel like I'm not wearing anything, and SUPER light. The cushion is adidas bounce, which is fantastic. Great at shock absorbing without being bulky. Even the laces I love. Just perfect. AND they look good AND they're cheap. Happy customer. Week One Review:
So far I'm happy with these. Like others have said these do run a bit small; my 13 is much closer to a 12.5, but the give on the soles means I don't actually feel that tight with socks on. The support thus far is excellent. I have a standing desk and walk to and from work, and so far my legs have really appreciated these shoes. So far pleased with these. This is my second pair, I bought the red one first, loved the fit -very comfortable, the sole is perfect for running and not too soft like the foam-bounce material which I have with my other adidas running shoes. Definitely recommend it!!. And they are BEYOND FABULOUS. Quality is great, very comfortable, light and stylish looking. This was by far one of my top 3 purchases on Amazon for 2017 (and I do buy much stuff here). Good job, Adidas. Fit perfectly (as I would expect with the size I ordered). They look nice and are breathable which is nice.Good going out in the city shoes for walking. great shoes for travel. they are so elastic you can slip them off and on for TSA. very well ventilated and comfortable and the black on black design makes it easy to combine them with dark jeans for a dress-up look. for short trips these are the only shoes I carry. Thank god I found them on AMAZON because I bought them on a store and thought I was never going to find another pair."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Performance-Bounce-Aramis-Running/dp/B01H66XO4E?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MXLVA3U&psc=1

Luckily for me, I found it for slightly less plus free shipping. Once I received an 11, the shoe fit perfectly, is very comfortable, and i love the look of it. They fit well, but the quality is obviously not there at Nike anymore. I have wide feet... like, Hobbit style wide... so it's always a gamble about whether a pair of shoes will even slide on past my arches. On the plus side, they look great. (I ordered the geode teal/black color combination.) On the negative side... I couldn't even get them on past my toes (and going a size up probably won't solve my problem with how narrow they are.) Looks like I'll be returning them. I don't dislike anything about these shies. I'm a Barber and stand all day long and these shoes give me the support I need Runs *just* a little small. Certainly not to the point where you would consider moving up a size though. Very comfortable once broken in, with excellent cushioning. I've kept the laces loose so they fit. Really comfortable though once you figure out how to wear them	https://www.amazon.com/Mens-Nike-Air-Max-Sequent/dp/B075ZVMLHR?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00UIME52O&psc=1

They have fit very snug. These are much thicker feeling in the sole which is a nice change. Also, these have a much wider toe box than my previous pairs of Inov8s, which might be important to some people looking at Inov8s with a more wider foot than me. Alot of complaints on Amazon about this brand is that they fit too tight. Well these are the exception and might be a better fit for those runners with wider feet and looking for a bit more room in the toe. However they are good running shoes. Im 59, 185#, and run around an 8 minute mile If that helps you. I would order again but hope the next version has more mesh in the toe box. Good grip. Wide fit and 8 mm drop works for me. Plenty of cushioning with a solid feel. Looks good. I feel like there is extra room in the toe box compared to the previous inov8 shoes I had - road talon. I like slightly wider shoes due to a bunion and so far I like these shoes. Really lovely shoes. Almost no break-in period. havent really had them long enough to give it a fair review but so far so good. Probably < 30 miles on them indoor track, Treadmill (grumble) and about 10 miles on asphalt.

pretty okay Perfect fit"	https://www.amazon.com/Inov-8-Mens-Roadclaw-275-Sneaker/dp/B01N7FPB6U?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MTY42XK&psc=1
315	15	Adidas Duramo 8	['Rubber sole', 'Fashion Trend: Ankle-High Synthetic Running Shoe']	"These shoes are very comfortable and good for running. All of those fit great in size 11 but these are way too small. Fit was good, comfort level was good, but not exactly what I was looking for so I returned them. The duramo 7's really were a magic shoe in comfort level and cushion. Now, none of their newer shoes fit my feet at all. I was ordering these older shoes like the Duramo's in size 9D and they fit good, and now they are much longer for their widths. 9D is much too long. The similar look and shape and fit of the Duramo 7, just firmer. My old running shoes were Adidas, and I got GREAT use out of them, especially since I received them slightly used from a friend (a friend I like to call ""lost and found""). I decided to stick with Adidas, and, since my old ones were 8.5, as were an even older pair of Nikes I still have, and 8.5 seemed to be the size that most frequently fit best when I attempted to go out and shop for new shoes, I decided to go with 8.5D of these shoes (the D refers to width, apparently, there are a lot of stupid letters attached, but I've noticed that wide shoes tend to fit me better). These shoes fit wonderfully. I haven't worn them running, yet, as it's been chilly and raining/snowing still here in MN, but I hope to break them in running soon. Really like this shoe. I do an easy 3.5-4 miles daily with my dogs. These are well made, solid support, nice durability. I would recommend these anyone that does roadwork daily and needs a pair of shoes that really absorb and rebound.Also at a great price, like $37 when I purchased... Good, light weight, all around shoe. Looks better with white laces. If your feet are wide, you might want to get a half size larger to give the toes a bit more room. I usually wear an 11 wide, but in this shoe a 11 1/2 works better for me. I normally wear a 10 and I feel like a 10.5 would have even been too small. Felt like I was wearing a shoe that you see elderly people in, with the very thick soles. Great value, but if I were to use these for running, I would definitely go with one of the boost models. That's what I had before, and when I wear them side by side, I can feel that the boost shoe absorbs shocks much better than this model  or any running shoe from a different brand that I have tried on. If I don't wear the Duramo side-by-side, it feels perfectly comfortable, though (at least for walking, I haven't tried running). They are fairly comfortable, the tip of the shoes are kind of ""pointy"" which I do not entirely mind for work because usually the front of my work sneakers wear out and look funny but this feature seems like it would prevent that"	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Duramo-Running-Shoe/dp/B07FF2L4PD?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07F8B2BM3&psc=1

Cushioned footbed. Shock-absorbing midsole. Synthetic outsole. Imported. Measurements: Weight: 11 oz Product measurements were taken using size 11, width D - Medium. Please note that measurements may vary by size. Weight of footwear is based on a single item, not a pair.']"	Every other pair has been wonderful, wore like a dream. I took them out of the box and they immediately felt different in my hands than all of my other ASICS. They did not fit my feet correctly (like the sole and cushion is off) and just felt super cheap. When I compared them to my other 5 pairs - they are definitely not the same. I only gave 1 star because they look attractive, but like some people that look good on the outside, they are ugly on the inside. I usually wear a pair of inexpensive ASICS like these for training and have another pair (Brooks or Saucony, typically) that is a bit more specialized for running. As a cross-trainer, these shoes are fantastic. They fit superbly in my typical ASICS size (9.5; I wear a size 8.5 or 9 in dress and casual shoes), with plenty of room for my toes to splay. I like the wider toebox found on most ASICS models; offerings from other brands tend to sometimes cramp my toes a bit. These shoes are very supportive, with multiple overlays holding my feet in place. They are bulky and sturdy, which is why they aren't really a running shoe for me (probably a bit heavy for that), but they do give me much-needed lateral support for training. The outsole has a solid tread pattern and appears very durable. The insole is removable which is great for me as a wearer of orthotics. For a running-specific shoe, you may want to consider a different model (I recommend Brooks Launch or Saucony Cohesion models for that). I hope you found this review helpful. I normally can fit into a 12D/M just fine; however, these feel a tad snug compared to my other shoes. I probably should have gotten a 13 instead, but I can tolerate the snug fit since it's not foot damaging level. Other than they feel nice and far more sturdy than the New Balances I had before. I have been wearing asics gel flux running shoes for several years and liked them. It looks like the gel flux is no longer being made and I decided to try the gel vanisher as a replacement for the gel flux. But since then they have been good. The support of the gel vanisher seems good. If you can figure out the models and numbers your better than me, so I look for the most gel for the money...I look for the cheapest gel sole. Since I am not a serious runner, it is hard to spring for the $150 models in my local store so I shop at Amazon and EBay for my utility ASICS. Great shoe. Stepson loves them for every day use in high school. Nice dark colors don't show as much dirt as lighter ones. Asics haven't disappointed us yet	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Gel-Vanisher-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B071VTT551?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0776ZYS1Z&psc=1

This time I ordered a size 12US and it fits great. So, just keep that in mind when ordering that you probably have to go a half size larger for a good fit. Gel Cumulus have always been the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. These shoes are great for that, they have great arch support. So far so good. Hopefully the new ones will last longer than the last pair. Great shoes. I have been distance running on and off since 2003 and have tried a couple other brands and shoes, so I'm not biased, and I always revert to Asics. I have already recommended them to several people within my running group. I've really enjoyed the 300+ miles that I've put on the Cumulus 18's and may get another pair before they are gone from the market altogether. PROS:
Super cushy but still controlled. Heel counter support is good but feels a little looser than GT-2000 or Kayano (which makes sense as the Cumulus 18 is marketed as more as a neutral vs. support shoe but I would argue it's biased towards support). Good durability - contrary to some other reviewers, with ~350 mostly pavement miles on these shoes the highest wear tread areas are just now starting to become even with the softer foam (see pic). All other areas of the shoe are holding up very well. The White colorway is quite attractive and different from the bright/neon colorways popular now. That said, white shows dirt very easily. CONS:
Heavier than most neutral shoes and ultra-cushioned shoes like Hoka. If you're not a heel-striker, a lot of the cushioned comfort won't be evident. Like most ASICS, you may want to size up 1/2 size, especially for runners due to foot swell. Or for those of us who like our toes to roam free. Kinda tall-ish looking - definitely not sleek like a low/no-drop minimalist shoe (Heel Height: 23mm. Forefoot Height: 13mm. = 10mm. drop)

Tread could be more aggressive like GT-2000 and Kayano. Ive been a fan since the very first Gel Cumulus shoe 20 years ago. Ive been a loyal follower of the Asics line ever since. The best feature of this shoe is the cushioning. I am a heel striker which means my natural running motion will force my heels to always strike and push off the ground first when my feet land. This shoe cushions my heels and the full weight with ease and guides my feet to strike at the mid-foot when me feet land which is what you want to have happen. When I hear the word Asics, I generally equate that with great quality. While it is true that they run (no pun intended) a bit on the expensive side, you wont find a pair of running shoes more comfortable and functional than the Gel Cumulus line. However, there are other Asics line of shoes that are adapted to different people as well. I am confident that you will be able to find an Asics line of shoes that will fit your needs. In my humble opinion, the Gel Cumulus shoe is well worth its price"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-cumulus-Running-Shoe/dp/B017N0N308?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FZKTQ22&psc=1

They held up really well in all conditions and fit perfect as the size is true to the number. I ordered these hoping these were going to fit the same and continue to live up to the legend the brand has been to me for so many years. The fit it is true, they are very lightweight and only time will tell how well they hold up. I absolutely love how great they feel on my feet. These were nice looking shoes out of the box. I purchased a size 12, even though my feet are closer in length to an 11 or 11.5, because my feet are quite wide and sizing up is usually the easiest way to go and has always worked fine. Really nice shoe, runs about 1/2 size smaller. usually wear a 10, but read size and fitment charts for Puma, and the euro size, and compared to other shoes, so purchased 10 1/2, and fit is perfect. Shoes are ridiculously light and comfortable. Buena calidad muy comodo
Me gusto para el entrenamiento diario ejercicio correr o caminar volvere a comprar en otros colores the most comfortable shoes i ever had. Great shoe, runs small. Fits perfectly.

319	19	Asics Gel Excite 3	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately Low-Top"" from arch', 'Low-mileage running shoe featuring rearfoot GEL cushioning and a removable sockliner that accommodates orthotics', 'AHAR high-abrasion rubber in critical areas of the outsole', 'Reflective overlays']"	"I like these shoes. They are lightweight, fit evenly, provide some cushion without being too soft. My feet are on the wide/flat side (I can't wear standard size Nikes without pain, for comparison), these are just a little snug width-wise but provide good support that way without being tight. Typically for me, an 11 is too small and 11.5 just a little loose, and these fit just right for me. I buy these when they pop up at the big box stores and these were found on an Amazon lightning deal. Again the fit was exactly as I would have expected, they seem to be very consistent with their sizing, so will be buying these online from now on. I'm giving these shoes 4 stars even though I returned them. These shoes have good lateral support and are deep enough to accommodate my custom orthotics. The right shoe fits perfectly but the left is a little tight at the widest part of my foot. There's room for improvement so I'm always looking for shoes that fit my left foot better. I was surfing Amazon's site looking at ASICS shoes and discovered their nifty ""shoe sizer"" that uses a data base of 3D and 2D scans of some brands of shoes to aid in the selection process. It let me input the model, size, and width of my NB shoes and indicate how they fit: good, a bit loose, or a bit tight. I said, ""a bit tight."" It recommended the size and width of the ASICS model that best matched my current shoes (apparently ASICS run small because it recommended 9's and 9.5's--my shoes are 8.5). A 3D ""scan"" suggested how that ASICS shoe would fit relative to mine using colors: red in the ""tighter"" areas, green in the ""same-fit"" areas, and blue in the ""wider-fit"" areas. Very cool technology. It would be great if it could show them all at once. The ""shoe sizer"" recommended the ASICS Men's Gel Excite 3 in 9.5 4E and said they would feel looser in the toes, wider than normal, and true at the heel. My orthotics fit fine. The right shoe fit fine but the left shoe was narrower than my New Balance M1540v2. I wore them around inside my house for two days hoping the fit would improve but it didn't. Quality-wise, they're very good and the price was about a third of what I paid for the NB...for that I'm giving them 4 stars. My podiatrist recommended Asics, but the colors at the store were too bright for my taste. It was love at first fit. The shoe seems to be a bit wider at the toes than women's shoes, which is fine. They are comfortable all day long. Walking without shoes is excruciating for me, so I don't take them off until necessary, but with these, that's never a problem. I really like these, and do not get all gushy over every product. I went to Ch__ps to get a new pair of ASICS just like my current pair. Happened to check on Amazon, and there was the next generation of Excite (3). Saw these in another mall store for 110, and another strore for 68, so when I saw them on Amazon for HALF the price I hit the Prime buy button. Perfect fit, perfect colors. Just like my old Excite 2s, less the worn out soles and worn uppers. I am a fitness coach and often wear ASICS because they are very comfortable in which to work and save my feet after a long day on them. I have never ever had stinky feet in my life until wearing these shoes. They do not stink when I wear other shoes. He has a wide foot and these fit him perfectly. He has been wearing them around the house all day for the past few days without any complaints. I will update my review when he has had a chance to do a lot of standing and walking on them. So far, so good. Have always been a fan of ASICS running shoes. They fit well and as expected. They are very comfortable. Good looking, to me at least and a great value. I ordered a 4E shoe in order to help alleviate some of the pain that I've been suffering with ingrown toe nails, I am also equipped with special orthotics that I had made, because of plantar fasciitis, (sp) these shoes work perfectly for me, they are light, and have good ventilation to help keep your feet cool. I am easy on my shoes, as I am no longer as active as I once was, so I expect these shoes to last a long time. The main reason for buying these shoes, is they have good arch support, an absolute must, with any pair of shoes that I buy !"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Excite-Running-Shoe/dp/B00YBBRA3Y?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00PY064TW&psc=1

I highly recommend these shoes, and will be sticking with this brand for the foreseeable future. These shoes fit my feet like a glove as every other pair of mizuno shoes has in the past. I had a pair of the wave sayonara 3s before these and I loved them. Best running shoe I ever had. These are pretty good. For 60 bucks Im not complaining. Fit's perfect. The wave shadows are comfortable. I previously had a pair of Mizuno Wave Rider 13 and loved them. So far Ive put about 12 miles on these and love them. I normally wear size 10 including my last pair of Mizunos but decided to order size 10.5 after reading reviews. 10.5 fit perfect. Mizuno wave is the the best platform on a shoe right now but it dont like the cheap look of plastic. I loved it !. Great Great Great !!.

I don't think I can buy Altra products anymore, unless I am somehow convinced that they have resolved this major issue. Best thing I can say is you don't have to worry about loosing your shoe midway though your run. :) I'm a backpacker (ultralite) and I've written reviews on the Lone Peak 2.0, the 2.5, and now this Olympus. I should say that as far as I am concerned, the Lone Peak 2.0 is the most comfortable shoe I of any kind that I have ever had on my foot. And it is fantastic for PCT-style hiking. I decided to give the Olympus a try because I was interested in the thicker soul and the Vibram tread. The Lone Peak 2.5/2.5 have a pretty good tread, but it tends to wear down relatively fast. It was only by a small amount, but it was nice. However, it also seemed like the top edge of the heel pocket was just a little higher, and I found that it started pushing up into my ankle bone when I was going downhill. The Vibram tread is nice. It feels good on pavement. I've never had an issue with the Loan Peaks, where I felt like I needed more sponge, and I actually like feeling the variations in the ground I am walking on. But still, the spongy soles have a nice feel. I don't know if this shoe has a rock guard, like the Lone Peaks. Walking over gravel and rocks was pretty cushy with the Olympus. The lone-Peak 2.0 had a great rock guard. I never had a problem. The 2.5 beefed up its rock guard a bit, and that was okay...though I felt like I lost a little ""feel"" for the trail. I think the extra sponge will be nice on the sidewalks. The main problem I have with the shoes is the lateral toe support that reaches around just enough to push in on my little toe. The v2.0 on top has hundreds of miles on it, and you can see that the later upper is almost like new. And if you look at the side of the Olympus, it appears that Altra may have had other shoes rip in this spot, so they wrapped the toe support around to cover the little toe. I'm just guessing about the ""why."" But in any case I suppose I'm back to the v2.0 Lone Peak as the hand's down best shoe for those who want space for their toes to expand. Still a Vibram sole would be nice. To heck with Nike and all the money they spend on image when it should be R&D like these companies. My podiatrist recommended this shoe, along with some particular inserts, metatarsal pads, icing, and stretches. They were expensive, so I hope to only have to wear out one pair. I found the size 12.5 Olympus 2.5 (same size that I normally wore in the Olympus 2.0) fit fine. As I plan to use these shoes in a 100-mile trail run in about a month, I will save them for that race, rather than continue to wear them on my daily training runs. But that has to do with my natural stride"	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Olympus-2-5-Athletic/dp/B01N4GHR90?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01N5R99TK&psc=1

It's an interesting idea, I guess. I need a stability shoe with good arch support. This shoe feels stable (it is labeled that way by UA) and it is light. I think it has a nice amount of cushion without being too spongy. I don't know if it's going to have enough arch support, and the support is not exactly in the spot I need it most. It will come down to the arch support. If that seems ok, I will keep them because I like them otherwise. These shoes were highly recommended specifically for people whose feet tend to roll inward when running. So I really wanted to be happy with them. They felt ok standing and walking but just werent stiff enough to offer any support for my foot when running. I gave them two stars instead of one bc they were ok for walking and standing, not terrible but not spectacular. I LOVE these shoes. These shoes are very comfortable and allow me to be on my feet for long amounts of time. They are also great for gym shoes. They fit as expected which is why I keep returning to Under Armour for shoes. Form fitting to foot and really flattering as well. I wish the toe box had a bit more support. The mesh above the toe area is a bit tooooo flexible for my liking. These shoes seem to be very light and airy which is great for spring and summer runs.... unfortunately I wasn't thinking about the fact that it's December and winter where I live. Might hang these up and try a pair of warmer weather running shoes or trail shoes. Seems to be a great running shoe. Other than that the shoes are super comfy, I work in a hospital so finding good shoes that dont hurt my feet at the end of the day is hard. Bonus they are also super cute. I get compliments all the time. These are the best shoes I have ever bought. It is the first time I have ever purchased shoes from under armour and I am quite happy with them. I have wide feet but my normal size (8.5) fit perfect. Also I have had them for a few months and the cushion on the inside hasn't worn down a bit. Very comfortable for running as well as walking. i am a certified medical assistant and I wore this shoe for 4 hrs. and developed an enormous blister and had to drive home on my lunch

I have tested them out two days at school and one day of intense shopping with lots of walking. My feet are no more achy than they are with my best sneakers. These have a nice springiness to each step, are light-weight, and look great since they are basically solid black except for the super white sole. I do wish they made these with a black sole. They are basic insoles with little support. I have high arches and Achilles tendonitis and needed a bit more arch support. I can't replace the insoles with my higher quality, supportive insoles. I'll be looking for a small arch insert to make these even better. Chuck Taylor like innersole. However, after walking a lot over the past week, they work great. I have owned several pairs of Asics and they are the best I have found for walking, especially trails. It also is engineered to be quite supportive of the foot. The top is very simple and holds your foot to the supportive bottom. They were great and reminded me of my first gel Kahanas, but a lot lighter and better looking. The only issue is that the light grey top picks up dirt too easily. My mother and my sister wear the same size shoes, they tried these sneakers as well since it looks cute but they had the same issues as I did. They are really comfortable with good fit and support. They are incredibly light weight it makes you feel like your wearing a very breathable sock. The soles have held up fine for me interfere normal use, very little running In These bit lots of miles walking I love asics. They are the best in my book. I recommend these or any asics to anyone that is one their feet a lot. Such a comfortable shoe. Thank you Amazon for the amazing customer service. Perfect fit, quick shipment & a great price. Ascis brand is what my Podiatrist recommends. I've owned hundreds of pairs of shoes and these are the most comfortable shoes I've owned in a long while. I use them at the gym when I cross train and I wear them when I work (I am a photographer) they are extremely comfortable and lightweight. I wear a different pair of Asics running shoes for running so I can't speak to the feel they give you for that but for everything else they're great and a great price.	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Comutora-Mens-Running-Shoe/dp/B0725R11WW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B076PHKDSS&psc=1

I really thought Kinvara 7 was the best shoe I've ever had. It was a great balance between trainer and racer....light, responsive, but enough support for some hard miles. The version 7 was a pretty good fit fit me. My right foot is slightly wider than my left, but still I had plenty of room in the arch and toe box to stay comfortable and free of blisters. But, 2-weeks into my brand new Kinvara 8, in pretty convinced they run slightly more narrow through the distal arch and lateral toe box. I can feel some slight compression that I didn't feel in the version 7---and it's a bit more than just support. I will say it's relaxed a little more after 50 miles logged in the shoes, but still feels awkward in the outer toe box. Overall, this is still a great dual purpose trainer. I have had many pairs of Kinvaras and they always fit reliably. In one way it is a good thing; there is more room in laterally in the toe-box but a little too much room in the forefront. Not a deal-breaker but going from my old pair to these is like adds about as space as removing a thick pair of wool hiking socks - if that makes sense... Not the seller's fault, but I'm hoping they will reach out and contact me about replacing them. I've had about 8 pairs of Kinvara shoes over the years, and I've loved all of them until now. Shoe is very comfortable with great heel cushioning. I run about 5 miles a night and they feal great with a smooth transition from heal to toe. I really loved these shoes but I may try the 9's later on. I'm starting Andrew Read's run/walk program from Run Strong. These are supremely comfortable, providing the right amount of cushioning for the beginner runner. They enable you to easily strike on the loaded forefoot, and use the calves/feet to absorb/transfer energy. the toe box was too narrow in my normal size, so I went up 1/2 size. Still a great shoe, but if you need a wider toe box you may have to up size. That leaves you feeling a bit long at the toe of the shoe. I got used to it, but a bit wider and it'd be perfect!!!	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072JZ5ZCF/ref=asc_df_B072JZ5ZCF1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B072JZ5ZCF&linkCode=asn&psc=1

The cushioning they offer is so comfortable without being overly soft, the shoe is light and offers good support around the foot. These are perfect for long walks, runs or days being on your feet. We covered 100+ miles during that time and these were comfortable and did not create any sores or blisters. I have expensive fly knits, air max, shox etc... and they are all comfortable for short - moderate periods, but these are much much better and i would wear these every time hands down. Excellent option I like these shoes overall. I bought these for a planter fibromatosis issue i have which so far has been good. They need better inserts though which i had that give me better support for higher arches. Marathon runner here (40-50 mi/week), great training shoe, liked it so much i bought two!. The GOOD:
1. Looks sexy
2. Has this interesting little notch in the treading right under your forefoot that is really satisfying to run on lol
3. Overall this has been the best training shoe I've ever had.
4. Has a higher arch so it's great for high arch feet like mine, less prone to injury I'm told.
5. Really comfortable, once I retire this shoe I'll probably use it as a casual gym/walk around shoe.
6. Great cushion for a neutral shoe. Amazing break in. It's a super common shoe so literally everyone has these
2. I suppose I could just use a pick to get them all out but usually i don't bother, maybe it's just an OCD thing... i donno
Read more I ordered the electric hair straightener for my husband to use on his beard. I bought a pair of these shoes (size 9M) last year from footlocker and loved them. I wore them for a couple weeks hoping they would stretch out but they haven't. These are a bit more narrow than earlier models, but they fit pretty well, nonetheless. They're still fit better than most of what's out there. With that being said however, they've clearly skimped on material for the sole, and there's less give/cushion than there used to be. The sole also doesn't extend as far out to cradle the arch and mid foot like the old ones, so there is some overhang. I would love to buy another pair of these, in fact, but I'm not really thrilled about the fact that the price was jacked up several dollars since I bought my first pair a few days ago so I'll be shopping around for a better deal. Love the Pegasus models. I purchased the same exact show in several colors and it's quickly become one of my favorite models ever. Fits extremely comfortably, wears well so far. Nice selection of really bright colors to allow you to be seen on the side of the road in order to possibly prevent you from getting hit by inattentive drivers.

The other difference is definitely a positive - the 17 seems to be better made and harder wearing. I'll be replacing them around 350 miles anyway, but it's nice not to be forced into it by structural failure. Whatever the reason, I'm happy to be getting a little extra mileage out of each pair - running 40-50 miles a week, buying a new pair of shoes every 6 weeks was a significant expense for me. I have one petty complaint - I wish they came in a wider range of more interesting colors. The current line-up is pretty boring. They were like heaven!!. I was amazed on how good my feet felt while running. We ran in the pouring rain and the shoes got soaked and were still comfortable. They fit perfect. I love them. Any recommendations between the 2 would be Great. I recommend these shoes highly!!. They are awesome. Thank you Brooks for making such a wonderful product. They survived a rough 5k and still look fantastic. The Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17 has proven to be my favorite go-to athletic shoe for several reasons. It is remarkably lightweight, and surprisingly supportive. I have plantar fasciitis and believe I have finally found the ideal athletic shoe for my endeavors. After nearly one month of wear and tear, the shoes remain comfortable, supportive, and durable. In my opinion, these shoes are ideal for overpronators like myself, and I cannot recommend them highly enough. 5 star purchase worth every penny invested and then some. These are the best for me. Everybody is different so what works for me may not work for you but for me these are the best. I have several pair because I wear Brooks Adrenaline's all the time I am casually dressed. That's how much I like them!!. These are not as comfortable as Beast but great running shoes. I have flat feet so it's important for me to get good support. I really love these and probably won't ever buy Nike, Reebok, New Balance or Asics again. Give these a try, they are really a great shoe. The price is a bit high but worth it in my opinion. The toe was a little too narrow for my liking in the smaller size. I searched forever for some good running shoes. Well worth the money. These are great. I have also noticed I dont have knee pain like I did in the Asics Gel. Well Worth the Investment!. This shoe was great at first - good fit and comfortable with the arch support I was looking for.

I cannot believe how much support they have and how smooth they are to run in. I used to run Brooks Beast which are more cushion, these are the energize sole which I have found to have a more gel feel to them. They align my feet and body so much better than my Beasts did. Glad I bought these. Looks good, feels good. Went for a run as soon as I got them and they felt good right out of the box. Great sneakers. Seems good, but fits a bit larger than my previous brooks shoes An amazing shoe by fit, support, cushioning, and comfort!!. Great looking shoe
No break in needed The energize soles really give an extra boost. These shoes are amazing. The sock like grip the shoe has around your foot will not allow you to slip them off. They have support on all sides of your feet. I wore these in NYC recently, walking 4-7 miles per day, sightseeing and never had foot pain. I would definitely recommend these"	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Bedlam/dp/B077K9MGZP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07D3H1FBF&psc=1

If I would have gotten my true size which is a 9 I feel it would have been too short in the toes and would have squish them. These shoes are really comfortable I originally bought them for running on the treadmill in the gym but they look really nice when I got them that I think I'm just going to wear them as fashion shoes and I'm going to buy some more for sure because they are the most comfortable shoes I have I have bought. My BF originally purchased these in famous footwear in grey and orange about a year ago and he loved them. I wanted to surprise him with a brand new pair since he has put so many miles in the other ones. I thought these all black adidas looked pretty cool in the photos so i ordered them. I will be returning these for a full refund, no way i can gift these raggedy ""new"" shoes"".

2nd review---- After returning the all black sneakers i ordered these again in the Collegiate Navy/Legend Ink/Core Black color. These shoes looked great. No glue or scuffs like the other ones. My only complaint is that it did NOT come with the original shoe box, it was just a amazon box. Just keep that in mind when ordering if you are giving them as a gift the original box might not be shipped. The shoes were alway sort of unbending but reasonably comfortable. Actually the box they came in would be as comfortable as the Adidas. I would have given it 5 stars up until about 5 minutes ago when the size label came off of the tongue of the shoe into my hand while putting the shoes on. Fluke, maybe, I will take my history of bad luck into consideration lol. These shoes are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned(as of 4 hours on my feet). I drive a manual transmission car and I have had to retrain my feet to drive because I can not feel the pedal, that's how comfortable they are. I can't say enough about how awesome these shoes are. But I took a chance and I'm so glad I did. They re light, fit pretty good (except if they're worn loose they feel like they may come off but that could be because I'm not use to shoes like these in type and specifically) and they look great. OK just got these today, shipping was very fast two days. I love Amazon so I am biased, but my sneakers were already laced and they even laced the laces through the little tab on the tongue. These sneakers look even better in real time, the pictures do no justice. I have only wore them around the house for a little while and they are extremely comfortable but provide nice stability as well. I wear 9.5 in the Adidas Shell toe sneakers, but I bought these in a 10M and they fit perfectly. Light weight, breathable, stability and comfort, the color is great along with style, all that is left is wear and tear test. I love these shoes. They're light and they feel like I'm walking on a cushion of air. Actually, they're better, as they're much lighter and better ventilated. Back to the Adidas, they're easy on my ankles and knees, and a joy to wear. Highly Recommend!"	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Cosmic-Running-Shoe/dp/B0725Q9SD5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MRZMI9T&psc=1

The price was great so that's what prompted me to try it out. They arrived quick and seemed to fit pretty well. But wearing them out for a couple of runs has made me wish I had gone a size bigger. The shoe is well constructed. It is light and, other than its width, it is pretty comfortable. It has nice flexibility and soft insole, while providing good lateral support. The arch support is relatively low, which I personally prefer. I find my feet feel more comfortable in wide shoes when available, but then again I have worn many athletic shoes from Nike and other brands that did not carry the Wide designation and still were wide and comfortable. I was getting ready to go run when they were delivered so I thought Id give them a try as I wasnt going to run far that afternoon. I was pleasantly surprised. I cant really say how they will hold up because I've only got 60 miles on them but so far so good. Ive worn out Nike, numerous pairs of Asics and am also using three different pairs of Hoka now and I just LIKE these shoes. The reason I rated them four stars is I dont like them quite as much as my Hoka Clifton but its very close. I really appreciate the bounce midsole. It feels very comfortable on short and long runs. Ran a 7 miler out of the box, felt great. The quality you would expect from a brand name like this is incongrous. . . Very tight fit, arch of my foot bulged-up the shoes tongue - feels like trying on ice skates. Returning Good quality shoe that arrived fast, great deal, and comfortable.

344	14	Altra Solstice	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Uses: Everyday wear, Running', 'Soft cushion', 'Minimal seam design', 'Breathable mesh']	"Great fit and feel to this shoe. I've been through what feels like all the zero drop shoes on the market and this is by far the most comfortable pair I've owned. The toe box is nice and wide, allowing the toes to splay. The sole was flat and provided a stable base for lifting and plyos. They are great for short jogs, lifting, and everything in between. I thought the Altra Solstice would fit the bill. The blue color is fantastic, vibrant and bold. It's definitely my favorite part of the shoe. Pros:
- Nice zero drop feel, sole has held up well for 1 month of use as daily kicking about shoes
- Color - vibrant
- Lightweight

Cons:
- Laces need some grips, they are awful at slipping loose right away so they have to be double knotted
- The insole in one shoe has worked its way up the back of the shoes. Overall, I expected more from the shoe, and the cons have outweighed the pros in my search for a casual everyday fun looking sneaker with zero drop. Read more Another great shoe from Altra. Loved these shoes. These shoe supported that effort perfectly. I would not recommend for the type of croos training where you will be performing a lot of direction changes and need ankle support. I love that they are zero drop, but most of their shoes have been hideous. These are great: a lot less ugly and a very fair price point. It will be interesting to see how they hold up over time, I've only been in them for 10 miles, but so far I'm very happy. I love them. These have four advantages over the others. First, even though they're zero drop, they have a little more cushion, which is nice for rocky terrain. Third, they're more comfortable, feeling very flexible and almost sock-like. Finally, they even work okay as a water shoe, if needed. I love Altra shoes I have owned many pairs over the last five years. There Solstice is the most perfectly shaped shoe I have worn. They are thin and light and for the shape of my feet perfectly. I finally replaced the insole with an insole from an older pair of Altras I had and they are now the best pair of Altras I have ever owned. Great shoes with bad insoles."	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-AFM1836P-Mens-Solstice-Sneaker/dp/B072JL1BTR?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073LZNDJV&psc=1

Great shoes here for the road runner Brooks shoes are superior quality. The fit was good and outer exactly as pictured. Another great brooks shoe.

These shoes are very comfortable and I can stand for longer periods without an aching pain. Overall, these are great so far. These shoes required no break-in right out of the box--extremely comfortable. These definitely do the trick. A 10.5 was perfect for me with these shoes. Unbelievable comfort for walking or trail running. This hoe holds up amazingly well and is extremely comfortable. I run mountain trails in CA , Utah, Idaho and Colorado with these shoes and might feet never hurt during or after. Four hill climb races last fall and summer and these performed better than any shoe I have ever worn. Will buy extra just to make sure I have them for years to come. Great job Merrell !!. Very comfortable and look great, very lightweight Ive had this now for a couple of days and have about 10 miles in them so far. They are super comfortable. The width was accurate and great since I heard this brand can run narrow. They didnt even have to be broken in to feel great. I would recommend these for sure. Bought these for my boyfriend, he loves them. Says they're super comfortable and that he might take up running again. lol Not why I bought these, I loved the style and look.

I've run about 100 miles in them so far and cant believe they aren't showing more wear. So long as Topo keeps a similar fit and quality, I'll be a loyal customer. Pros: Comfortable fit, very light, lots of cushioning, breathable, great looks. I love them and would buy again. Cons: Minimal ankle support. I don't run on trails in the woods but these are the best athletic shoes ever. Took a four mile walk on asphalt and they have nice cushion in the soles to absorb the path, but nice and soft on the feet from the very first wear. The MT2's fit like a dream, are very stable on woods trails, and are quite nimble. For best fit, I ordered down a 1/2 size from my other Topos (which I also love). Great arches and a very comfortable fit, considering that I purchased then over the internet without ever trying them on. Husband is super picky and our son recommended these. He absolutely loves them and says they've never bothered his feet from the first wear. These shoes looked good and have all the features I was looking for in a trail/road shoe.

At first the sneakers seemed small & even tight, (I wear 7 1/2 in almost all brands), but after a couple of runs & workouts, the toe box seemed to stretch out & they fit ok now. They are a little heavy for treadmill running, but great for outdoor runs. If you want a solid, structured sneaker with a lot of stability & support, than the Omni's are the best of the Sauconys. I would then say the Guide model would be the next less stability control model & finally the Ride model for the lightest & moderate support. I'm pretty convinced these are fake. They have been my favorite for several years. Loved them ALL! Best, most comfortable shoes for my moderate pronation. The sidewalls are super rigid/plasticy & the toe box is way narrower (& I have narrow feet). I wanted to replace these shoes because they were so comfortable. When they arrived, I didn't take them from the box because I thought they would fit just like the older ones. It is too late to return them so I suppose I'll give them to a friend with a smaller foot. I hope customers take note that your shoes are now at least 1/2 and maybe a whole size smaller than the originals. Loved the Omni 14s, one of the best sneakers I've ever had so was excited for these and obsessed with the pink color. The toe box is not as large as the omni 14s, which is why I loved them so much. I also have bunions so i do better with larger toe boxes. Hope they widen the shoe next time. These shoes are by far the best pair of shoes I have ever owned. It's been about 3 weeks since I've had them and I am pleased to say that my PF has subsided substantially. Not as aesthetic as the prior models, but much better balanced. Sure enough, I needed a half size larger than I had in all the others. These are fantastic shoes for my needs. Remember though, shoes are just like wine: what works for you is the best.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Womens-Omni-16-Running/dp/B01N2WJQFP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MS4S8CU&psc=1

Yes the run small so one size up is best. I wear a 12 and I use these in a 13 seems like all UA shoes are like this tho. Make sure to size up and it's money well spent. They're still great and comfortable. The only con was the grip isn't that great at first, but after a couple weeks of wearing them they seemed to get better in that department. When I read the reviews about them running small, I thought the 11 would be fine. They were too small, so I ordered the 11.5 and I LOVE them. The return was easy, so it wasnt a big deal. I think theres an option for amazon wardrobe for these. Id recommend that if its available. Im breaking them in and they are better but will stick to shoe stores. Fits Great.

Ive had 2 knee surgeries and these shoes are still comfortable enough to jog in. 2 issues I had was sticky stuff on the laces when I received them. The other is the toe of this shoe has a support piece so the toe looks solid and doesnt cave in. Well the support piece on both shoes has caved in. Doesnt affect comfort. Just aesthetically ugly. like these shoes, fit as expected, comfortable and gives the support needed. I have high arches so it's really tough to find shoes that are good for my shoes. These, however, were great. Affordable and good quality giving the support I need. Giving only 4 stars because the soles are extremely white Great style, comfort and support. Surprisingly good for a low profile shoe. Great pair of sneakers. The feel and fit wonderfully. They look nice also. A must have The picture looks better than the real thing.

Great shoes. This is my second pair of Asics that I have purchased and I purchased them simply because of the comfort of the shoe. New Balance was my go-to for comfort shoes, but Asics is holding their own in providing a very comfortable shoe. I am a youth pastor and often take students to a lot of events that require a lot of walking around between activities, I look forward to seeing how these shoes fair during our week-long summer camp this year. I would definitely recommend these shoes for purchase, size and fit are perfect and run true to size. The top of the back has an arching tongue protruding upwards, instead of a U design to fit your back heal. This pair is barely useful, except to walk slowly in the shopping mall. It is unfortunate, because it has great cushioning for long runs. Do not buy if you want to stay free of injury as a runner.

The 860 series has been fantastic for me over the years and various iterations. I did not purchase these shoes on Amazon, tried to contact New Balance with no luck regarding a minor issue, but thought I would let people on Amazon know about it. These are excellent running shoes, but with one very minor issue. Oddly enough, while the ink and coloring transfer very easily onto your socks, it is almost impossible to remove from the sock with washing, bleaching or even using stain remover. Aside from that, the shoe was comfortable and looked cool. They also provided decent support (had PF with high arches) and ran lighter than their weight. Thankfully the store where I purchased the shoes offers a full credit if returned before 50 miles and no heavy wear. Traded them outright for the Adrenaline 19s, which have been great.	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-860v9-Running-Shoe/dp/B07D8FF94V?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07K2Y432K&psc=1

I have not used it for runs longer than 9 miles because the cushioning does not feel as thick as the Pegasus 34 which is a good long run shoe, or the Hoka One One, which is a heavy tank. It might be OK for longer runs, but I will use this for shorter runs and introduce more miles later. Had fallen in love with the ZoomFly2 as a running shoe but the version I prefer is not available anymore. After putting a few miles on them, I think it was a good choice. They are light and easy to put several miles in. Im not a huge fan of the tongue construction (the shoelaces run along the very top of the tongue) and the break in took a little longer than others Ive had, but I would definitely consider another purchase. The only thing and it isn't the shoes fault. Otherwise these are great light shoes man. We had the advantage of being able to try this shoe on at a local store before purchasing. Our local sporting goods store did not have the correct size so I checked Amazon. We were able to get the exact shoe we tried on for a better price. Great mix for short or long runs. Really impressed. I havent found anything wrong with Elite 9 other than they are discontinued. I've ran in many shoes and I really like these, from 5k to half marathon The Zoom Air's are great. The shoes fit as expected and they are super light while providing support. If you are looking for a light, supportive and fast shoe...this is the one. My feet feel great in them. These shoes are great but the right side feels a little different from the left where the arch is.	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Air-Zoom-Elite-Running/dp/B077QR5588?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07C9152T6&psc=1

I took a backpacking trip to Havasupai Falls the day after a major storm had passed and I was surprised how well the FriXion Red outsole shed mud and gripped wet rock. This trail gains 4000ft in 3.5 miles on a ridge with some pretty loose terrain. The outsole has been near perfect for me in the performance category. The midsole has performed admirably as well, but the ride of the Akasha can best be described as slightly harsh. The firm dual injected MEMIex midsole is perfect for hiking and backpacking, but I found it to be a bit too stiff for longer trail runs. Even after passing the 100 mile mark, the Akasha midsole still lacks in forgiveness. I really like that stable and responsive ride for long hikes and days were I have a heavy backpack. The performance of the Akasha upper has been admirable in temperatures under 80 degrees. I love the support and protection that this shoe offers, but the tradeoff comes with a lack of breathability. I also found the Akasha to dry slowly and not drain water very well when submerged. I live in a very dry climate, so this is not really problem for me, but the heat was an issue in the summer months. Read more Once again La Sportiva has developed an amazing Trail Running Shoe. I'm a fan user of this brand, I have tried all of their trail running shoes and must say that the Akasha is my new favorite for long distance. Perfect combination between confort, grip and stability. For me works very good because I have wide feet. The sizing in La Sportiva runs little, I would recommend to order at least 1/2 size bigger. For those looking confort on long distance this is very recommended. I did a competitive 30km trail run in mountains of Altai, and here is what I can say:

Pros:
- Great cushioning;
- ""Bomb-proff"" protection;
- Super grippy on muddy and technical surfaces;
- Good water drainage ability;
- Satisfactory signs of wear (lugs). Cons:
- Runs small;
- Lacing system could be better;
- Price;

In overall, I was very impressed with this pair of shoes. Great for all day running on technical trails. The shoe wraps your foot well so it feels lighter than what the status say. Planning to buy a fresh pair for my next 100 miler. Más pequeños The shoes have great grip in them and endurance in mind. Tested them on a 4 mile run up an easy slope. Did wonderfully. My only complaint is the rubber on the outside toe box likes to pinch my big toe. Run small, but my favorite trail shoe I really like the shoes.

The size is perfect. Since it was on the side I didnt want to go through the hassle of returning since you couldnt really tell. Other than that, these sneakers are really nice. Bought these for my husband and he is a big fan. Great looking shoe. My 14 year old son loves them and says they feel great on his feet. Thank you. They are comfortable, my feet don't hurt that much when I am done with my shift. I care a lot about looks also, and this pair go good with anything. They look cool unlike other work shoes.

The price was right so I bought this style, which appears to be last years model (seems like there is a Launch 5 available now). I am a neutral runner with medium arches and I require a support insole with my shoes (Superfeet Blue). My first impression is that this shoe is a definite step above the ASICS models I have been using in terms of support and the responsiveness of the cushioning. My feet feel very stable in these and the bounce back from the cushioning is fantastic. The fit is also excellent. I am a 9/9.5D and the 9.5D fits me like a glove. The rear foot/heel cup is nicely structured, and the mid foot saddle holds my feet in place. The insoles were easy to remove and replace with my Superfeet. Overall I am very impressed with this shoe and look forward to putting some miles on them. To me its worth it to pay a little more for quality. An excellent running shoe. In other words, I recommend ordering a full size up from what you normally wear. Other than that, I love these shoes. They're really comfortable, and great daily trainers. (Note: I rotate them with another pair of shoes, the Mizuno Wave Rider.) Bought a 1/2 size larger than my everyday sneakers but were too snug in the toe box. Bought the 2nd pair a full size larger and now I run in joy. I never had experienced the joy of running in the right shoes until after I broke these in. At long last I have found the perfect shoe for runs. Do yourself and your body a favor and try these. I'm pretty biased towards Brooks due to the way they fit my foot compared to other shoes I've tried in the past. Couple that with the relatively light weight of this model and a runner with a mid-foot strike should be happy. Plus the b/w speckled color looks cool. Oh, and the lace loop that keeps the tongue straight is also a nice touch. Uh, and one more thing: the fact that there's actual rubber on the bottom rather than just terminating at the white mid-sole foam like free run style shoes means you don't have to worry about them wearing smooth after a walk around the block. From a comfort and support perspective, there is a pretty significant difference between the Launch 4 (Color style #486) and this model (Color style #062). With that said, this mode (#062), l actually feels like it has a bit more support (but that might be that I am trying to compare them with my previous pair that has 300+ miles on them). Wish I would have purchased directly from Brooks so I could return them... Brooks has a great reputation in the running community, and the Launch 4 is a great example of why that is. However, I was able to get a good deal on this version and went ahead and did so. But I would say it's a good everyday trainer that will give you good support all the way through a half-marathon distance. They are comfortable, look great and feather weight. Brooks are the best shoes out there, one bad experience isn't going to change that opinion. All my old running shoes used to give me various blisters, and I'd be pretty sore even after just doing 5k on a treadmill. These shoes are fantastic, and have totally improved my running. My feet aren't dying the whole time, they're comfortable, and they fit my size 13 foot great. Yeah they may be ugly, but these are shoes made for the purpose of running, I wouldn't want to waste their prime just walking around in them.	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Launch-4-Mens/dp/B01MRIBL8H?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07CMHSSXD&psc=1
367	7	Nike Air Zoom Pegasus 32		"I checked and I've run in them 50 times and have about 287 miles which is pretty low. My other Pegasus were shoes I could and have comfortable run 10-13 miles in. I may use these a few more times, but I will be fortunate to squeeze out 300 miles when my other pairs have been in the 330 range. ORIGINAL REVIEW

These are my seventh pair of the Pegasus. I started with the 29's and have had good success so usually buy several pairs of each model. This shoe is the right weight for me (just below 12 ounces in a size 11) and provides a good solid ride. This model has a few different features, with the side lacing and stability the most radically different but overall it works very well. The shoe in orange with green laces looks great (to me) as a Hurricanes fan but there are many other color options. The inserts in my other shoes (Saucony Guide 8) are much sturdier and provide more support. Read more It's a solid shoe for daily running that has its pros and cons. Pros:
+ Feels comfortable on the foot during running
+ Breathability is good

Cons:
- The sole feels a bit too hard for me. Since then I bought Nike Lunarepic Shield and Adidas SuperNova 8, which perform much more reliably in both dry and wet weather.
- Sole pattern is such that small rocks get stuck in it and you have to pull them out periodically I enjoyed my previous Pegasus running shoes, they saw me through many miles of running asphalt and single track dirt and finished two marathons... loved them. The new ones are comfortable, they are extremely light, but they are narrower. I bought the Pegasus because of their high rating for supination but the narrower shoe allows my foot to roll to the outside much easier then the previous shoe. I only have a few runs in on them since the purchase, and they were very comfortable. I will run these shoes out, I am not disappointed with the purchase, just liked the earlier version better. The shoe is supportive and comfortable on my neutral-arched feet. I have plantar fasciitis and this is the best my feet have felt in months. I ordered these because I saw they had great reviews for those who have plantar fasciitis, and they were not lying. Highly recommended!!. I love this shoe!. One of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Great cushioning in the heel area, and plenty in the front as well. I can wear this shoe all day long and on into the evening and they are still comfortable. Outstanding. I don't usually wear Nike's but these are a great shoe. Supportive for everyday walking and wear. They are supportive and comfortable with the added bonus of being aesthetically pleasing. Haven't used them for running but in terms of stability, comfort, support, and style....these are an A+. I've been running in these for 10+ years, they're a great neutral runner that are perfect for supination. They fit a little looser than they have in years past, but not enough to warrant changing your size if you've had previous models"	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-Mens-Zoom-Pegasus-Running/dp/B00QFJI854?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00ZARGMBE&psc=1

I like to look for the information I need to make an informed decision. I finally decided to give them a try and I am glad I did. Now I am not up to long distance running yet, but for the 3 to 5 miles I run this is an awesome shoe. The fit is right on, the width feels good and the support I get from the shoe is helping me to last longer. I will definitely look to get another pair when it is time to replace these. Size was fine but if you run and are used to wave riders these are not running sneakers. They are very cool looking though but I ordered another pair of wave riders for running and these will be causal sneakers I've always appreciated Mizuno's styles and fitting. Light where they are great for intense workouts, but also sturdy and durable. I like the design - it looks good. I bought the shoe 1/2 size larger than my size.- it fits very well. I am comfortable running in it - it is really light. My 12 year old loves these shoes for school. He really likes the color too. Fit as expected, bought at beginning of school year, not a lot of sign of wear so I'm hopeful they'll last. The shoes look great but they come a little bit small/tight and narrow on the toe area of the shoes so take note, you might want to order a t least a half size bigger than what you normally buy Shoes are narrow, but I will loose-lace them as slip-ons because they look cool. Thought they'd be a little more better suited for cross training & a little running after reading reviews. Not the case, will wear them for casual attire.	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Mens-Synchro-Running-Shoe/dp/B011XEPBPU?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B011XE3V4I&psc=1

After reading reviews from world champions in obstacle course racing they swear by the shoe brand. And now that the newest version is now released to the public I jumped on it and I am very satisfied with my purchase I can't wait to see how it holds up to the Ultra Beast. :) The shoe has a good appearance; however, even though it is the same size as other running shoes that I have worn, the toe box was too small and the length too short. Great shoe for rocky and sandy terrain as you can see in the photos. The fit is perfect for my narrow foot, great insole, well constructed but just wish the lace design hugged my foot a little tighter as you get a little play below the lace line.

EXCEEDED ALL EXPECTATIONS , I HAVE RECCOMENDED TO MANY DISC-GOLFERS who have Bought them and loved them as well . Perfect shoe for outdoors and outdoor sports like hiking and disc golf. Excellent shoe, the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. These by far are the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. Fantastic traction, great arch support, materials are great quality as well. I wear these as a daily shoe, they last me a year and a half or better. My previous shoes were no longer comfortable enough to allow me to get around much without pain levels spiking too the point I would have to get off my feet and rest. I went on the search for a more comfortable shoe following a doctors and physical therapist recommendation. I found these, wow what a difference, again amazingly comfortable and great traction to help me keep my footing when walking. The things i like the most about these shoes are that they are: comfortable, lightweight and, of course, waterproof. They seem to be about as lightweight as my Adidas running shoes which is a definite plus. However, after having been on multiple hikes and trudged through mud, tree roots, rocks and other terrain, the shoes seem to have held up really well. Ok for occasional rainy day urban walking. These shoes are probably some of the best shoes I've owned. I've been scouting out buying a black pair for casual fashion urban day/hiking as the ones i have right now are of the olive green variety. I needed a cool pair of Gore Tex shoes for those snowy days. These fit the bill nicely. First off the fit. Quality of these shoes is fantastic. Traction on ice and snow is quite good and they will be extremely durable shoes . I like the look of these shoes as well. Great Hiking or walking shoe for inclement weather. These are the best sneakers I've purchased. The fact that I did so without trying them on is a bonus. I was running out of time and decided to take a chance and they fit perfectly (maybe a quarter of an inch too big but once you walk in them your feet expand and they fit nice and snug). Another amazing thing about these sneakers is the laces system. And the best thing about it is that I don't even touch it. My older much cheaper shoes did a way better job on wet surfaces. Not sure what happened here but it's a pretty big flaw. Would've deducted two stars but I just love these sneakers in all other aspects. This one was a little light and fitting was way better and that was the reason I chose this one. The yellow color got nasty looking fast, but they are very comfortable, with minimal break-in time and have great traction when scrambling on rock. Love the GorTex lining. I bought a fourth pair in grey and put them away for next year. I hope they aren't going away?	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-outdoor-Mens-Terrex-Swift/dp/B01HLPAWXQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075MRKY2Q&psc=1
374	14	Nike Free RN Distance 2		"These are possibly my favorite sneakers ever - great for running, great for walking around, and great for lounging around. At the Nike Runners Shop in Manhattan they explained these to me as a ""Free"" shoe, which encourages forefoot strking and a flexible footbed, with added extra cushioning foam to make these suitable for longer runs. This update to the ""2"" model looks a little better than the original, although I am not fully sold on the tongueless design but I love the new pull-tab. The definitely run small - I go up an extra half size when I buy Nikes now - so while I'm really a 10.5 who buys 11, in Nike i need an 11.5 I bought one pair of these shoes in a sports store as a size 10. I love how comfortable they are. I've been running for 25 years now and these are the first nikes I've really enjoyed running distance in. Great fit, light, and good cushion. These shoes are built around a neoprene sock and fit like a glove. Very light, very comfortable. Highly recommended. These are by far the best nike's i have ever owned.They are super comfortable and fit perfectly.I am so impressed i have ordered more just too have them in reserve.If you are into nike's i would recommend trying these. So far so good. Very light and bouncy, with OK support, which is what I always look for in running shoes. LOVE this shoe. It's like wearing baby seals on your feet. Very comfortable.

I was looking for black on black tennis that look good with my casual clothing for work. I will say for anyone without issue like I have, I love the look. First and foremost, I love Nike. The soles eventually gave out from regular use and not abuse. I think I just weigh too much for these (6'1, 225), they feel great on my feet, maybe a bit narrow in the heel (inside fit is perfect, but tread contact under heel is narrow so it feels like rolling an ankle is easy). The rigid design does not stretch out and it has a fixed tongue that dogs into the top of my foot. These run LARGE. I ordered a 10.5 and I swear I had to check the tag to make sure they weren't 11 or 11.5. These are HUGE in length. I'd recommend starting with a half size smaller than you usually wear and go from there. As for everything else, if you need good arch support -these ARE for you. I LOVE the way these fit my foot everywhere other than length. My arch felt cradled like a baby. These were awesome. Then I got s deflated sole on the right shoe I gave this as a gift to my sister recently and she loved this shoes. She said that it is ""very comfortable"" for her feet. It doesn't hurt her bunions. Fits so great.

Be cautious buying.

2/5/19 *UPDATE*

Contacted seller and seller quickly assessed the situation and made it right, thank you. I am happy with my purchase. They provide great support and my feet feel ""relieved"" after being in them for a while. Overall a very good shoe and if you are looking for shoes with good support for flat feet, I would highly recommend these. buy em, and buy em now, all the hype about boost is true, I did not believe what everyone said, but I do now. Must comfortable sneakers. I'm not a super serious runner, but I do love the Ultraboost shoes. They fit a little tighter than I anticipated, but I don't know that would have dissuaded me if I were trying them on in a store. They're durable and they look good. Overall, it's the most comfortable and lightest shoe I've ever owned. And I got a great deal! loving Adidas ultra boost are so comfortable Awesome shoes, just a tad on the small side.

379	19	Asics Gel Fortitude 7	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately 2.75"" from arch', 'Stability running shoe in breathable mesh with textured logo overlays and toe bumper', 'Maximum Support Last', 'Removable insole for orthotic accommodation', '', '', '', '']"	"These are great shoes. Before trying Asics the only proper fit was an 11.5 4E with the large 'N' on the side. In that 'other brand' every type of shoe fit the same in that size. The Asics feel the same in a 13 4E.
My first pair was purchased at a running store in a size 12 4E. They fit perfectly when crisp and new. This change is small; but for my feet it takes a full size out of the fit. The 12's went from perfect to blisters as I went for distances. I don't know which brand sells a 'true size', or how I would find a proper measurement for online shopping. My advice is don't assume these will fit like any other brand. I'm hoping to find some clearance pairs someday!. These shoes are great. He loves them and says they feel great and he can tell they help him. I'm grateful for the product. Also, these were true to size. ""Somewhat small"" refers only to the toe box; it's snug but not uncomfortable. Heel and mid-foot are a perfect fit. Asics stability shoes include the Gel Kayano, my favorite. Next comes the GT series which is an excellent training shoe for me. While in third place is the Gel Fortitude, it is the value purchase of the group. A visit to a therapist afterwards confirmed that I have collapsed arches, which means my foot does not have the same kind of springiness that helps support my body weight during walking. Sort of like driving a car the didn't have suspension - it makes for a jarring ride. I then looked for a pair of good athletic shoes I can use with foot support, and this product does not disappoint. It's like walking on air. Woohoo. Have had these for almost 2 years as my regular casual and workout shoes and love them. Very supportive and comfortable, I needed a good well-reviewed stability shoe. Outstanding build/construction and materials quality- the shoes look like new. This was the first pair of ASICS I purchased since the Dr. recommended I switch from the previous brand I was using. They fit well and I got close to 400 miles out of them before retiring them. The fit is excellent, the toe box has plenty of room and the material used for the soles is shock absorbent thus making the run smoother. This shoe brand is one I highly recommend. You definitely get your moneys worth."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-GEL-Fortitude-Running-Shoe/dp/B00OU6PKCS?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00Q2JC23Q&psc=1

381	21	On Cloudsurfer	['Mesh', 'On Inc Mens Cloudsurfer, Spice/Shadow, 8.5']	I love these shoes, they are wonderful. I can wear these shoes without even having inserts and they feel great. They are true to size as well. I got the teal color and it's a great look, very stylish as well as comfortable. From what I understand OTHER On shoes are perfect for rowing, burpees, et al. I know it's a very small subset that does this workout, but I wish someone had posted a review like this for me to see. Now I am in love with this shoe but it doesn't work for what I need it for #quandary I was curious about these running shoes and trusted that avid runners with renowned Swiss ingenuity will have developed something great. The toe box is straight and not tapered as you may find on other running shoes. That is a great plus. Instead, because they are so smooth it is very easy to pull them tight which is (again) a great plus. But it has not bothered me and has not caused any discomfort whatsoever. You still have to do the running yourself and if you want to become faster or run farther you have to run, run and run. Finally, I like both my ASICS Gel DS and the ONs. I have loved every pair, until this one. These shoes are true to size. I loved the shoes, they were extremely comfortable, but I couldn't keep them because that extra half size was too awkward. I could not return them because I wore them a few times and had thrown all of the packaging away, so I gave them to my sister-in-law then ordered a monochrome black pair of On shoes in the correct size, which fit like a dream. Love these Cloud-surfer's, they fit perfectly, I am a size 8 in sneakers most of the time. The ride is amazing, so comfortable and smooth, definitely live up to the name. Best ones yet, tried all brands before, including Nike and Reebok. I work on my feet and depend on good footwear to save my joints and back. From the moment I first put them on, I can't stop wearing them. The cushion is fantastic without being stiff or bulky, and there is enough give that your muscles still naturally work to flex, walk, run, etc. A great physical therapist did the bulk of it, but I really think these shoes have played a significant role in my being able to run. They are super comfortable for long runs. They run a half size small by my foot and do wear out fast if you are a heavy-footed runner like me. The company will replace them if the pillows break within a certain mile limit. Give them a try, that is the best advice for any shoe. They fit like they were made for me right out of the box, really nice look and color scheme of pale orange/grey. Extremely comfortable on roads and trails as well as on the treadmill/at the gym. Excellent fit in the heel/midsole, with plenty of room in the toe. I recommend lacing them up all the way to the top to provide more ankle support, they will still be very comfortable.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MTWBHK1/ref=asc_df_B01MTWBHK11555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01MTWBHK1&linkCode=asn&psc=1
382	22	Inov-8 Trail Talon 235	['Synthetic', 'Lightweight, designed for speed', 'Ultimate grip', 'For hard-packed trails']	"I really wanted to love this shoe; it's light for a trail shoe, the lugs aren't too big, and it's reasonably form fitting (for the shoe category). I have always used road shoes as I thought the comfort and performance of road shoes out-weighed the potential benefit of big lugs and support of a trail shoe. But when I saw these I thought maybe I should give them a chance. I will update after a few more runs, hopefully with a better experience. I'm sure if I ran an easier pace on trail I would be less demanding of a shoe. 2) I'm used to racing flats, which are about as comfortable and form fitting a shoe as I've ever worn. I'm not expecting the Trailtalon to perform like a racing flat, but I still expect to be able to run a long trail run it comfortably. For a first test run I took them out for a 20-ish mile trail run at a comfortably hard pace - one I knew I could keep for 20 miles but still pushed myself. For the first 10 miles I was trying to decide whether the added mass and impact of the lugs were a worthwhile tradeoff for a little bit better traction; and I informally concluded that it might be, especially if it was muddy or the dirt was softer. But when running uphill the lack of support put considerable strain on my arch, something I've never experienced with road shoes. As I mentioned, it was a first run, so maybe the shoes take some time to break in; I'm used to racing flats being good from mile 1. Perhaps they would be fine for short distance (< 10 miles).

Excellent looking shoe
Quality is superb
Very durable
Very grippy especially in the wet / grass
Relatively lightweight

Cons
Very subjective, but do have more achilles issues
Had to use with gel heel insert
(Do have this issue with Inov 8 shoes) Inov8 trail shoes are designed for specific off road purposes. Light and fast and well constructed overall. Truly surprised about how light they were, (not realizing that 235 meant 235 g). Very comfortable right out of the box and looks great. The not so aggressive lugs prevents mud/grass/dirt to build up while maintaining a great amount of grip. Bought as a gift for my son who is an avid runner and obstacle course runner. He uses them daily and loves them . Got these to run The Gauntlet OCR. Water retention was near zero within a few steps after exiting water, traction was great in the mud and on obstacles, and they fit well at size 15. A+ Inov-8; well done.

The trouble is worth it, as once I figured out sizing, these shoes have been a dream. They fit like a glove but don't constrain my toes. They work for mid-forefoot running, and don't feel high heeled like Salomons. The rubber of the outsoles is as sticky as advertised, and unlike other big tread trail runners, I felt good grip on slippery hard surfaces. Perfect for the Pacific Northwest. This is my third La Sportiva shoe and I like it best. Lightweight, great side support, adequate arch support, sure-footed, and fun. I marked this as somewhat small because the width is narrow...which is perfect for my feet which claim a B width in a dress shoe. I especially like the lacing because I can customize the fit. I like this old-fashioned tying shoe lace. The tuckaway pocket is neat but takes some getting-used to. The shoes fit great (finally). Love the traction and my foot is really locked in. Ended up ordering three pairs to get the right fit. Both the Amazon and La Sportiva fit estimates were off...for me anyway. I bought these shoes for a Grand Canyon rim to rim hike. Would recommend a little larger yet. Aside from that they were very comfortable, had great traction in wet and dry, across sand and rock. They did fine keeping my feet dry across creek crossing. I've been in search of great, not good, OCR shoes since my Inov8 285s bit the dust eariler this year. They are fantastic shoes and would have been my choice, but they are just a tad too narrow. If they had fit I may have never found the Mutants. So glad the Icebugs didn't fit. My experience with La Sportiva shoes has been great so I gave the Mutants a shot. The Mutants are pretty light for the size of the shoes. The lug pattern on the sole is very aggressive, and the shoes seem to be built for off trail use only, but they are surprisingly very comfortable and as responsive on dry, hardpacked trails as they are in the mud and goo. The unique tongue and lacing system are like nothing I've ever seen or tried before, but they work to really hug your foot into the shoe. At Killington, these shoes proved that they belong on the list of great OCR shoes. I would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a great shoe for OCRs or for trail/off trail running. Read more Best fitting sneakers I bought in years. I totally agree with that. Most of all I love the arch support & the lacing system that pulls the arch upwards to your own fit. It has a sticky grip it's a great trail shoe as well as an approach shoe. I like the unique look but that's all about your personal taste. The mutant shoe is much like the old c-lite to me, meaning a glove-like fit that is adjustable, conforming, cushioned and a great runner, be it on trail or road to get there, but the front toe bumper is much better designed. It is super sticky with an aggressive tread, so talus running, boulder hopping, or slogging around are also at home. The high collar keeps out grit, while the lacing system, with overlapping tongue, hugs the foot perfectly. All the above mentioned contribute to high levels of confidence in your running allowing you to forget about the shoe, and focus on your technique and the wonders around you. Notes:

The shoe runs small, so 1/2 size larger is required and a perfect fit. I normally run in 0 to 2mm drop shoes, and was concerned about the 11mm drop, but it's a total non-issue, so don't let that keep you from trying a pair, as my running is improving using these. The picture shows no carry loop on the shoe, but there is one to help get the shoe on."	https://www.amazon.com/Sportiva-Mutant-Backcountry-Trail-Running/dp/B00KVLH1DW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07C46MLL5&psc=1

I laced them up this morning and was very impressed with their fit. The Versafoam cushioning is very comfortable on both the heel and forefoot. My medium foot fits well in the medium shoes that I bought. I look forward to a few hundred miles in these beauties. I have tried bandaids and vaseline with no success.

Hole ripped after not even a week of ONLY gym training
DO NOT BUY

Before they ripped I was decently happy with the vivobarefoot shoes. They ran a little large, i wear a 9.5 in Nike and ordered a 9 in vivobarefoot and they fit almost perfect. The shoe constantly creases in certain spots and is rigid causing pinches and pokes on some spot (pic 3) (this might break in but the shoes won't last long enough for that to happen). Felt very connected to the shoes as they fit not too snug and not too loose.
2. Sole of shoe felt good

Cons
1. By the third day I was usually ok to run again. I was skeptical at best when I got the shoes. Step speed 185 plus - easy. After a run legs feel energized, not tired. Amazing. Light, grippy, and great road feel. Comfortable without socks. They are mash, which is great for breathability, but expect grit in your shoes if you take these offload or into dusty conditions at all. Love them!. My feet feel so much better. The benefits to my body, health, and biomechanics are as expected. I bought them to walk in and they are fine for that but there Mobus fitness and mesh trail runner are better shoes in my opinion for walking and or running. I have no idea how long they'll last mileage wise but I'm sure no where near what traditional style shows will. I do like them and the way they feel for what I bought them for overall and things down there feel a bit odd when you switch back to traditional shoes because these truly make you feel connected to the ground. Vivo is the best shoe I have found for ultra minimalist and wide toe box. It's almost like walking barefoot. I like this model. Very nice shoe. Well designed and comfortable. If you have flat or wide feet I would recommend the Stealth II instead."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NYVN9WB/ref=asc_df_B07NYVN9WB1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B07NYVN9WB&linkCode=asn&psc=1

I was lucky to get them for $70 but I would have paid more if I would have known how well they feel. Really helps with the petella tendinitis in my knee. Arch support is solid as well. I have never gotten so many compliments on a pair of sneakers. The Indigo Blue/Hot Orange/Black color combination looks really, really good. I love Asics for the most part (they make the best tennis shoes I have ever used) but this brand can be very inconsistent in sizing and toe box design. As nice as these look, I won't be getting them again. I honestly never thought I would wear them. I tried them on and was pleasantly surprised with how they fit. So of course I checked amazon and they had them cheaper. Some details I like are listed below:
-Wide toe box. I have very wide feet so these fit awesome. These are great for the summer as it helps prevent athletes foot with the sweat.
-All black!. These shoes have a small reflective area on the back of the sneakers to help light you up. Another great feature about the Asics GT-1000. But just stay out of the puddles and you will be good. I ordered the wider size (first time I have ever ordered a wide shoe) and it fits much better. Good shoe once you find the correct fit. Overall I'm happy with this running shoe. I wore out a couple of GT-1000 3's which I was very happy with. They lasted, and provided great support. One very important thing to note is that my version 3's were size 8.5, and fit perfectly. Seller emailed me several times asking if everything was OK and offering help if not. I used to where Nike air Pegasus shoes in a 13 4E. They had a nice wide toe box. ""Had"" being the operative word here. Not only did they narrow the Toe box from side to side in width but they also made the Toe area with less depth, from top to bottom. The first pair I wore was a cheaper version, they fit good but the inside had some areas that rubbed my feet so I put some sticky pads to prevent blisters -- that was not a major problem. I'm a real big man, at 260 lbs, and I'm middle aged (as we age, things like feet start to hurt in places that were never a problem before), The Gt-1000's fit lie a dream. I thought, finally, someone makes a pair of shoes that fits me great. Well I'm on my third pair. I went ahead and ordered a new pair in my usual 13 4E. They arrived in 2 days (Thank You Amazon Prime!). Its to narrow and its to shallow -- just like Nike. Why is it that when I find a product I really Love, they have to go and F it up. If it aint broke, don't fix it. I've searched every Asics shoe offered here at Amazon and this has happened to them all. If you have wide feet and you have a chance to buy Asics -- I suggest you try something else. If you find a pair that fit, please let me know. I dang sure cant get a wider shoe. 4E is it"	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01FZKV5FI/ref=asc_df_B01FZKV5FI5866986?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01FZKV5FI&linkCode=asn&psc=1

390	0	Asics Gel Pursue 3	['Synthetic-and-mesh', 'Fashion Trend: Ankle-High Fabric Running Shoe']	I usually wear a men's 7.5 (women's 9.5) but I ordered a full size bigger in this and it fits perfectly. I'd recommend ordering at least a half-size larger than usual. The shoe is REALLY comfortable, and highly recommended for supinators like me. Nice heel support when I jog ( at 236 ). A bit snug when I first tried them on but now they feel fine. I was looking for another pair of Asics in a different yet cool style. I'm satisfied with what I have. For me this shoe is the best fit shoe I have ever worn this is my sixth pursue 3 shoe I have owned, I have bought them locally but last two online this pair for some reason took longer to get but overall I love the shoe for comfort stability My husband has a high instep and this shoe fits well. This is the perfect pair of shows for gym and city walks. It supports the arch foot very well. It may not be ideal for winter but over all it's the best sport shows I tried so far. A great shoe. Not overly soft and yet at the end of a long run my feet feel relaxed and comfortable. I recommend ordering your normal size. Excelente product, the size was great and the delivery awesome, tomorrow I will by other pair.... these put a spring in your step, great support and bounce, sharp looking too	https://www.amazon.com/Asics-Mens-Gel-Pursue-3/dp/B01M5DJYG3?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BLRPN3Z&psc=1

7. They look bit bulky but upper material is snug and enough supportive.
9. Good shoes for colder temperatures.
11. Do I recommend this shoes...depends on type of foot and preferences YES. I really enjoy wearing these shoes. The cushioning in these are awesome and extremely comfortable. The only reason I did not give these a 5 star rating is the outsole can be very hard to clean. Great show, but its hard to slip on and off since the design is a bit restrictive. Disappointed because the show was very comfortable otherwise and good value. Very nice for walking around or wearing daily. I love the shoes cool but is there a secret way to put them on cause it's Hard as hell to get them on but once I'm in we rolling all day comfortable just to hard to get in them good luck. zapato muy moderno para correr pero faltó mas comodidad para el pie MY SON LOVED THESE SHOES!.

They are super light and and well vented. Pretty comfortable. I had the Motion a couple of years ago and found that I liked the Gravity more but the Motion runs well. Most Newton shoes are pretty good for my running style which is landing my forefoot and less heel. Not Amazon's fault, it is the 3rd party company who should have contacted me or Amazon when they don't have my color and size in stock. I purchased another pair back in January and loved them so much for running that I decided on another pair in a different color. If you are looking for a light-weight Running shoe that provides for a great run, try the Newton Gravity 7. I have run in Newtons for years, they keep getting better even as I get older. These are fast, springy shoes which are still my favorite. Great shoe, but might not be for everyone. My another shoes was a Newton and changed to Adidas Ultra boost Parley, three times a used it and no more, again back to Newton VII, Nice and confortable, exceed my expectations, now hit the road Interesting shoe. They took about a week to break in and get used to but now theyre quite useful.

393	3	Asics FuzeTora	"['Synthetic-Mesh', 'Imported', 'Shaft measures approximately Low-Top"" from arch', 'Seamless Construction', 'MONO-SOCK Technology Fit System', 'Ortholite Sockliner']"	"I have wide feet, but would order a half size down and feel it would fit better length-wise. These are really comfortable, light, and breathable, but the best part are the insoles - they seem to mold to my feet as I step and spring back up for my next step, giving my toes something to grip. The design of the upper part of the shoe is unique, in that, although there are laces, it is literally one piece (no tongue, no two sides which laces normally pull together over the middle of topside of your foot), so the laces can only tighten the fit just so much. The design makes my feet look really wide, but my toes can stretch and it's really comfortable. The fabric is very breathable, so can't wear in the rain without socks getting soaked, but hopefully will keep my feet cool. Sole is flexible so I can wear it for exercise class which includes floor work where we sit crosslegged (my more supportive running shoes have soles with more lugs that make them heavier and less flexible). If you like them to wear, buy them. Not a running shoe.

Upon second take, they aren't a bad shoe. Its a great looking shoe but hard to get on. Toes look like theyll tear through with any pressure. I really wanted to like them. Comfy, light, and with great support. Doesn't look ridiculous. Light and comfortable. Highly recommended. Loved the color, very light weight Still getting use to this pair I will have to wait.

These are much like the 18s and have finally again gotten rid of the rub points towards the toes and switched the fabric for more breathability. Great shoe. Great arch and stride support to help correct and support your natural strides and arch, and the Lite reflective model looks great. Most comfortable running shoe Ive ever owned.

I don't know what ""secret sauce"" Brooks put in these shoes, but there is a NOTICEABLE difference in comfort/feel between the ""Beast"" shoe line and the ""Addiction"" shoe line. I tried the cheaper ""Addiction"" line before but they felt STIFF and didn't seem to absorb shock well at all, felt like walking on a hard piece of wood to be honest and the shock went RIGHT to my knees (ouch!). The shock absorption is surprisingly good, it's on par with even more expensive shoes. I would say the New Balance motion-control line in the $120-$160 range is a close second, their shoes were pretty comfy too.

- a happy Big'n'Tall guy
Read more I remember my parents complaining when I was a kid that they needed to pay $7.95 because Converse made the only sneaker that fit my wide foot. Do they walk for you, allow you to walk on water, or leap over tall buildings. With a price tag that's more than a minimum wage worker grosses in half a week, they should do all three...and make phone calls as well. Seriously though, they fit my wide hooves and are comfortable. Most importantly, they allowed me to complete cardiac rehab (and continue at a gym afterwards) without any further knee damage/pain. Very comfortable shoes for a person who needs arch support. This was OK when the '12 & '14 Beasts cost was around $120, but not OK at the new average $160 price point. Bottom line is, that if used exclusively for running, you won't find a better arch supporting shoe that is more comfortable at any price point. Brooks is a great company with integrity, are consumer conscious and will go out of their way to ensure customer satisfaction. ( check out their website, if you haven't already done so )

Nike once ruled that domain exclusively but that's since changed now that I've discovered the Brooks Beast 14s, 16s & Adrenaline GTS 17s which are perfect for me. Once I find an atheletic shoe that fits me perfectly and are stable and comfortable, I get several pairs and save them for future use just in case the manufacture changes style, quality, fit or comfort. Beast 16s are good for any distances long or short... GTS 17s are good for shorter distances... I alternate between which shoes I do my daily walks in but listed in order of favorites:

Beast 16 - insanely comfortable
GTS 17 - comfortable, super light
Beast 14 - comfortable, more ridgid

Best of success in whatever you decide to get... Check out my review for Brooks Adrenaline GTS 17s

P.S.
Issues I was initially experiencing with slippage in the heel have been resolved with change in lacing patterns... I walk minimum of 60 miles per month, average 100 miles, max 150-200 miles.

a. min 3 miles/day first thing in morning.
b. avg 6 miles/day : 3 miles morning & evening

Since getting Beast 14s & 16s; the past few weeks Ive easily been walking 5.5 to 7 miles in one session five days a week. Superb Cushioning.
b. Excellent Arch support.
c. Excellent Motion Control ( over pronation ) ankle roles inward. Cons:
Heel Box isnt very snug - resolved
Toe Box is a bit cramped - partially resolved

Costs:
Beast 16s are expensive, list price is much more than Ive ever paid for a running shoe before. Fit & Feel:
Feet feel great in Beast 14s. Love this shoe, no complaints. Beast 16s has lot more cushion and better arch support than Beast 14s. Beast 16s feel really good, much, much better than Beast 14s in arch support, motion control, cushioning and transitioning from heel to toe when striking ground... Beast 16s also feel better than Beast 14s in landing and transitions from heel to toe. The Beast 16s feel so comfortable, like walking with pillows on your feet, but not too squishy

Id go as far to say, Beast 16s are much better shoe than Beast 14s  if  they  fit  perfectly and are  completely  comfortable to  your  feet. I agree with Brooks statement that Beast 16s are insanely comfortable with following exceptions, which may be particular to me only, so you should give them a try, not just in store or on carpet, tile or wood floors at home, but actually walking in shoe outside on routes you normally take ( just be aware of your retailers return policy in case shoe doesnt work out for you ). I like my  running  shoes to feel snug like a glove, I want them to move with me and there be no slippage or movement in the shoe: up or down, back or forth. I recommend trying the Beast 16s performing the normal activities in environment you plan to wear the shoe in: outside, on treadmill, elliptical, trail, road, track or otherwise. Just make sure you understand return policy for worn shoes should you have to return them because they simple do not fit or feel good. Some places give you 90 days to try them and free returns and full refunds. Other places may give you 90 days, but you get a credit towards future purchase of any of their merchandise. Some offer 14 days and others offer no returns, unless not worn at all

Wish shoe manufactures could maintain fit and sizes while enhancing comfort and adding additional technology when releasing new versions of the same shoe.

History:

I have been wearing a size 12 D in all shoes ( dress, running, cycling, basketball, football, casual, etc ) since I can remember. I never had to get a size larger or smaller to best of my recollection. I used to wear neutral running shoes exclusively, but put on some weight and started wearing motion control and stability shoes later for arch support and cushioning. Nike stopped making  real  motion control and stability shoes while back and I had run out of my stock ( when I find a shoe I like I purchase 6 or 7 pairs to eliminate issues with manufactures changing styles and shoes not fitting / feeling same ). I went to several well established and well regarded running shoe retailers that had treadmills and cameras to analyze gait, pronation, arches, etc Unfortunately, the shoes that were suggested didnt fit nor feel comfortable in store so I knew they would not feel comfortable nor fit when walking and putting them through my normal paces

To reduce time in trying shoes for initial fit and comfort, I ordered at least 15 pairs of shoes in sizes 12, 12.5 & 13 all widths  D  ( normal ):

a. New Balance 990 v4

Asic sizes were very small didnt support arches and were squishy. Saucony supported arches better but where to squishy ( cushioned, but no support )

New Balance 990 v4 are good and Im still evaluating them; however, they dont compare to either Beast 14s or 16s in arch support, motion control or cushion. I like black suede and may keep them for casual every day or in gym. Initially I liked the Beast 14 best for the following reasons:
Stability
Comfort
Cushioning
Motion Control
Room in Toe Box
Heel Counter is High & Snug
Extremely Comfortable & Fit Like a Glove

The Beast 16s are shorter in length ( full size shorter ), toe box is cramped, heel counter seems lower and has more cushion at top preventing my heel from being locked in. The Beast 14s felt comfortable in store, home and wearing outside on routes and environments I normally use. Comfortable in all environments under all circumstances. The Beast 16s heel and toe didnt feel that good in the house. ( I bought them online because they were not available in any retailers when I got mine ). Irony is, when I took the Beast 16s out for a walk the arch support was phenomenal as was the cushioning. Its true what Brooks says on their web page, its Insanely Comfortable from cushioning & arch support standpoint. You feel like youre walking on pillows, yet its not squishy or overly soft. The Beast 16s feel unbelievably, insanely comfortable from arch & cushion standpoint"	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Beast-16-Mens/dp/B01N0B98HC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MTFQG7P&psc=1

Love the flat laces too. The greater stack height of the Olympus tempted me, but too many reviews said the Olympus gets quite heavy when wet, and my shoes usually get wet. I have a very narrow foot (size 13A) and although it does not feel tight it does feel secure. This shoe is great for every day walking. I have a hard time not wearing them more often but I want to keep them fresh for the trails. Best running shoes Ive had. When your toes can spread out it makes it apsolutely a whole much better experience. If youre trying to decide, just get these, youll be amazed. So I decided to take a few trail runs before I wrote this review to make sure it was a fair review. These are without a doubt the MOST comfortable trail runners that Ive worn. The zero drop will take some getting used to, but my legs and feet are strengthening daily and its all thanks to these shoes. The cushioning is superior and it feels like youre hiking/ running on fluffy pillows when you put these on. The shoes fit true to size and have a lot of toe room and forefoot room which is what I needed for wide feet. Dont hesitate to buy these if youre looking for a wider minimalist trail runner, you will not regret the purchase. I promised myself to enjoy life and be completely comfortable after retirement, I've tested several shoes, Altras are the only ones that are above standard, completely comfortable, very durable. They are perfect These are remarkably cushioned well. Best hiking shoe I have ever worn. my best running shoes since 4 year ago, lots of ultras with them, this timp are very good ones	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07G648YTH/ref=asc_df_B07G648YTH1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B07G648YTH&linkCode=asn&psc=1
400	10	Reebok Print Run 3.0	"['Mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top"" from arch', 'Reebook Shoes', 'Imported']"	"**I am a treadmill runner**
I love the way these shoes fit and I love how comfortable they are. Some shoes you can't tell if they are going to break in and become comfortable. These Reeboks feel great right away. They are light, well made and they look cool. I'm going to wear them around for a day two casually before I wear them on a run. This shoe is very light weight that fits great. My knees do not allow me to run any more but I do a lot of walking instead and these shoes are great for that. I assume they are good for running too I just cannot run any longer. These are fine for 2 miles at a go and then you can feel it in your hips and back. I have got compliments though from random people when I have just worn them around - they do look good. After wearing these for 4 months, I have found my other shoes from Reebok to be more comfortable. I got a pair of Nikes that were giving me blisters when running over 2 miles, replaced them with these and no blisters. I was able to get these for about 15 bucks they fit perfectly and are super comfortable very happy with his shoes just need to go in and get out running Super comfy and light. They fit but they are just a little long in the toe. Would definitely recommend. Liked the look and fit. Almost like your barefoot"	https://www.amazon.com/Reebok-Mens-Print-Run-Shoe/dp/B077Z99SB8?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077Z6LGWZ&psc=1

CUSHIONING: Light. STACK HEIGHT: 23mm. LAST: PFS1.5-M', 'MIDSOLE: InnerFlex EVA. OUTSOLE: Blown rubber FootPod outsole. INSOLE: 5mm Contour Footbed. UPPER: Lightweight Quick-Dry Air Mesh.', '', '']	I normally wear EE, but New Balance stopped making my favorite zero-drop shoe (MR00). There may be a engineering reason for this, but for someone like myself, who runs barefoot on the beach when able, it makes me feel slow and forces me to change my stride. I also bought a pair of Merrell Trail Glove 4s, which feel more natural, but they don't have the tread or cushion for long runs on the road. Back to the Altra's They are slightly bulky, which is to be expected with such a generous toe box, but they don't feel any heavier than slimmer shoes. They could be a bit narrower at the heel, but then they might feel less stable. One of the other reviews mentions the V3 picks up less gravel and I agree. But don't let that fool you; you'll still feel rocks that you step on. I wear a 40.5 (8 in US sizes) La Sportiva Mythos. I own 4 other pairs of Altras I like just fine (Instinct, Superior, One and Torin). The tongue is sewed into one side of the shoe (outer, pinky toe side) and on my foot (moderately high arches) this causes the tongue to only reach partway over the top of my foot, there is almost a half inch gap between the edge of the tongue and the other side of the shoe where the laces are. This is super uncomfortable just walking around and proved unbearable for running or working out. The fit is ALWAYS off. Even with all that, I love the shoe. For me that's a good thing. I like the fact that Altra makes zero-drop shoes, and this has helped me transition from being a heel striker to a mid-foot striker. The shoe fits the shape of my foot so well with enough room for my toes to splay, it felt really comfortable. Next time, I think I would stick with the same size because I like the way it fits with no slippage. I found it easy to wipe off the dust with a wet towel without getting the shoe all wet. This is definitely the One for me, especially given the price. After going through many running shoes over the years, this has been my favorite shoe	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-One-V3-Running-Shoes/dp/B01N9K4E1X?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B077P3DLTM&psc=1

OTHERWISE, these are great sneakers, fit wonderfully with or without socks and feel great when walking a treadmill or basic weight room floor workouts at Orangetheory Fitness. Great footbed. These Merrels really are great shoes, they're about as close as it gets to wearing a pair of socks. They are super comfortable amd great for leisure activity. Highly recommended this product Haven't really put many miles on these and the laces are about to snap. They are comfy for more casual wear, but I just bought 2 more pairs of normal and emesh versions for actual distance work... probably won't buy knit version again due to the lace setup. Generally recommend buying half a size smaller than your normal shoe size for all of the Trail Gloves to get a non slip fit. These are some of the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. They pull on like a pair of socks, and are light and breathable. They pack easily, so I take them with when I have to travel for work so I have something comfortable to wear around the hotel at night. Simply the best. Absolutely LOVE these shoes. The knit upper is very comfortable yet still supportive enough for all but the most extreme conditions. The shoes have a great balance between ground feel and protection on dirt and rock trails while working equally well on paved rounds. THESE RUN BIG... ****** Order 1/2 size smaller than NORMAL ******* I love these. Super comfy and lightweight. It's fine for jogging. Anything more intense I'd probably wear something else. I do wish the lace system pulled behind the heel more tho. What's funny is that these laces are amamid fiber (kevlar), which you can tell by holding the frayed end in a flame for a sec - it does not melt or burn easily. I do a lot of quick movements in Orangetheory and CrossFit, and this shoe always gives me a solid feel for the ground with minimal slipping. It works well for street running as well. I've bought more Merrell shoes after falling in love with these.	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Trail-Glove-Sneaker/dp/B078N6WXPG?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BF2X2BJ&psc=1
403	13	Topo Athletic Fli-Lyte 2	['', 'fabric', 'Roomy toe box', 'Printed Upper Pattern', 'Lightweight, Breathable Materials', '3MM Drop', 'WEIGHT: 8.4 oz (Size 9)']	"The Topo Fli-Lyte 2 is a simple, comfortable, light, cushioned running shoe that I find perfect for me. The Fli-Lyte 2 has plenty of room in the toe box, but provides a secure fit in the mid-foot area. They have plenty of cushioning without a crazy high stack height or feeling mushy (Hoka Clifton). The Fli-Lyte has been great for long runs and speed sessions for me (I don't have the opportunity to do speed sessions on a soft track). They are flexible and have a low 3mm drop, so they allow a more natural stride. Many other shoes I've tried with 10-12mm drops make me feel like I'm running in high heels, and those shoes tend to promote a heel-first foot strike. I also have a pair of Topo Ultrafly as well. I like them a lot, but prefer the lighter more flexible, less-structured feel of the Fli-Lyte 2 better. I would highly recommend the Fli-Lyte 2, especially if you are someone that finds themselves ""sizing up"" in a regular shoe in order to get the toe box room you need/want. The Hokas are great, except for the narrow toe box that gave me blisters. I liked the original Timp Trail (except they look weird), but the 2.0 model doesn't have enough height in the toe box. The Topo has toe width and height, as well as a soft ride that I like. Like the cushion and the toe box. Currently 400 mi on them and going strong. I like the feel in these shoes. Super comfortable. Holding up well so far. True to size also, Of note: I tried on the trail shoes in a running store and I had to go up 1.5 sizes to get a good fit. Have been running with Altra Escalante racers more frequently than the Topos and like them much better as I avoid rubs and anything I think will give me blsters ;-) I love the Topo fit- more anatomical but not loose. Love the desig ethos- less is more. These are a more padded shoe than my others from Topo (ST-2, MT-2), but they are not squishy and remain fully stable. I cherish my ST-2's, which seem custom made for my feet, but these give my 50+ body what I need for runs >5 miles. Still a fan of Topo, although some of the changes to the original trail runners aren't good, mostly with the fit and less durable soles. I hope this trend doesn't continue. lol be these shoes! 5th pair. I dont run or even exercise, but they are great. Nice roomy toebox. The shoe looks great and I'm sure works as expected. However, I had the first generation of this shoe in a size 11 and it fit great, but when I bought this model in a size 11, it was about a half size too big. Customer service was helpful in what they could do, which isnt much. I wish I could return them."	https://www.amazon.com/Topo-Athletic-Mens-FLI-Lyte-Running/dp/B071R6N1Z9?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B06ZZGVJFX&psc=1

Light weight, good fit and a great overall shoe at a great price. I tried these on after coming from the Gel Cumulus top of the line shoe and this is nearly as good. It's lighter, has a good mold to the foot and a good amount of cushion. Very comfortable with reasonably good ventilation. All but the black/white colours are pretty gawdy but that's up to personal taste. These are clearly comfortable though and do very well for running, as their description and name suggest. These shoes have been some of my favorite I've ever bought for my hubby. He wears a size 15 and it is super hard to find them that fit and usually when we do they look like boats on his feet. These shoes look great, he says that they are really comfortable, the colors are fun and vibrant (black white and coral) and he's been wearing them every day for the past couple of weeks and they are holding up well and show minimal amounts of wear. We are both very happy with this purchase. I was introduced to Asics because I'm a wrestler, and it's the most popular wrestling brand. I didn't have an opportunity to try their non-wrestling shoes until recently, and I'm very happy with this product. I am an avid Asics supporter. On the bright side, one of my patients needed a pair of shoes....I gladly give them to him. I truly hope that he enjoys them better than I did for the one day that I wore them.. This criticism is my point of view, someone else may think that these shoes wear great. Asics have always held up the best for me. It remains to be seen if they last past 6 months, but I run 2-3 times per week, anywhere from 2.5 - 5 miles and so far so good.

Normally I wear a 9.5 in ASICS and NIKE so that's what I ordered for these. When they arrived I thought they felt way too tight in the front especially, but somehow it still felt like my heel was coming out when I walked. The next day I decided to try switching out the insoles, one thing I really like about these is that the insole is really just an insert (not stitched or glued in) so you can put your own shoe insert in instead. I put in ""Instant-Relief Orthotics for Flat Feet by Samurai Insoles"" instead which are pretty similar in shape but less bendy. My feet still hurt a bit on the elliptical when I tried again but I didn't start to lose feeling like before. It's now the third day and I have to admit they're starting to feel better; I think they're finally starting to stretch out a bit. I still wish I'd bought 1/2 a size up from my usual size. Personally I'd recommend looking at other shoes, but if you go with these I might suggest ordering 1/2 a size up from your usual fit. Even though this is an earlier version in the Gel-Flux series, the fit was great and he didn't notice any difference between it and the Gel-Flux 5.He runs every day for about 6 miles and wears them out in about 3 months, which he says is pretty good considering the price for these on Amazon. I have flat feet and over-pronate so I found out that Asics GT-1000 stability shoes are perfect for me, very comfortable. I don't run but do like to walk a lot. Then I saw the Gel-Flux 4 on Amazon from Shoebacca for a great price that I couldn't turn down. According to description they are also good for over-pronators so I ordered them. No surprise... they fit great and are also very comfortable. Along with the great price Shoebacca shipped quickly. I've been wearing ASICS for 10 years and never had a problem with the size, unlike other shoe brands like Nike, which are a different size between models and years. This and another pair of ASICS that I ordered at the same time were about 1/2 size too small and narrow as well. My knees and hips especially appreciate it. Cushioning is similar to Gel Equation, with better back to front stability. I use Spenco Total Max insoles in these for more arch support because I have really high arches, and I am active every day. Together, it's an affordable and comfortable option. Purchased these for my 12-year-old son who prefers the comfort and fit of ASICS to any other brand. So if you're unsure, it would be wise to order your shoes slightly larger. These have held up well and can last my active son an entire school year. Overall, very happy with the comfort and quality of these shoes and every pair of ASICS to date"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Flux-Running-Shoe/dp/B01GUA28UI?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MY106B3&psc=1

This is the perfect 5k racing flat. Lightweight, with just the perfect amount of support. They fit like a glove and are springy for races and tempo workouts. Perfect shoe. I am a big fan of most of the Brook's mens shoes. This purchase was another great buy. Fit good, look good. Love that I have a light weight stability/racing option now. My Adrenaline GTS are great, but this is MUCH lighter. A race shoe worth the money. Worthy successors to the Racer ST 5s. I really loved the ST 5s and was really disappointed to find out that Brooks discontinued them. These fit and feel a lot like the ST 5s.

So I swapped in some stiffer shoe liners with better arch support and all of the pain went away. I pounded out a long 15 miler with no problem and my feet felt great afterward. After I got used to running in them, the stack height did not really bother me and the base of the shoe is really wide adding to the stability. However, you should make sure you are really used to them before taking them out on technical terrain. Hoka did a great job of listening to their customers and upgrading the Stinson's in response. Love my Hokas. That cushion is what made me love this brand. Recent changes to the shoe have affected the things that made Hokas my favorite shoe. Pros: plush cushioning; comfortable to wear if you are on your feet for hours;
Cons: not exactly a con, but Hokas , in general, seem to run about a half size smaller than other shoes. Awesome Shoes, Soles feel like stepping on air shocks!. Very light weight and comfortable. Hoka's are great shoes and very comfortable Little bit wide for my feet. But in the large side fits perfectly. It met all of my expectation Excellent cushion and wide shoes .

Now off of vacation I wear them around the yard while doing chores as they're pretty comfortable. The only improvement I would like to see is a bit more cushion/foam to the sole for even more comfort. I have a narrow fit, and Merrell's are known for being wider, and these are certainly true to form. Pros:
+ Thick cushioning and support throughout
+ Minimal heel-to-toe drop (only 6mm)
+ Good traction
+ Innovative lace feature seems like a nice addition

Cons:
- Will only fit those with wider feet
- Arch support is uncomfortable and out of place (pushes up significantly under the ball of the foot)
- Sizing is massively off on these (a full size!). The same size 11.5 inserts I used in those shoes fit perfectly in these. I wear 11.5 in nearly every brand and type of shoe, but the 10.5 fit my foot length perfectly with these. WOW, these shoes, as soon as I put on were amazing. Look great, lightweight, laces feel right, and lets see how they wear. Perfect shoes for the light trail hiking I do in the hot AZ desert - nicely ventilated and do NOT need any sort of Gortex - which only make the shoes not as ventilated and smell more. I had bought my last 4 shoes with Solomon - great shoes, but the soles wear out in much too fast of a time . Nice switch to Merrill - so excited. They always fit me perfectly. But I bought a different model and they were again perfect. toe box is a little different shape than others styles I've had in the past, but it's not bad. took me a few days for the outside of my foot to get used to it. but a lot more arch support than other merrells, too (not that those weren't fine, but this is pronounced). Very comfortable shoe. Great traction. Again, the comfort is amazing. I love Merrell shoes. Got the usual comfort I expect from them except for one thing: my left foot doesn't seem to fit squarely in the shoe. There's a tendon or nerve that constantly rolls off the side of the insert and it is pretty aggravating. Love these shoes. These shoes give great support and have some great cushioning. My first pair lasted 12 months, and are still comfortable enough to run in. I defenatly recommend these shoes. The length of the shoe is great, but the lacing system makes for a tight fit around the foot. After breaking them in, they feel fine, but I've got to be careful not to tighten them too tight. But I did just run a 16 mile race in them, and other than stopping to tighten them once, they preformed great!"	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Agility-Trail-Runner/dp/B01N4Q4JT5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MZIJAKT&psc=1

Nice sneaker with nice comfort. Perfect workout shoe. The only thing I wish it didn't have was the max written on the heel. More of a narrow shoe like my foot. Love these!. We have turf in the warehouse and my free runs have zero grip on it. These work perfect. Stylish too and comfortable. I have never any purchased Nike product before but I brought to support and I had a heel spur. I did not use them to exercise, for running, or anything intense. Happy with purchase.

They actually surpassed my expectations since they are so comfortable and solidly constructed. Another plus is the strap on the rear of the shoe (not sure what it is called). this helps keep trail pants (I dunno why they make them all like bell bottoms lol) up off the ground if they are wide bottom boot cut. A great value and a great looking pair of kicks. Immensely comfortable and superlatively cushiony, as nothing I've experienced in sport shoes compares to CloudFoam mid-sole over extended wear-time (12-month-old continuously-worn Kanadia 7 still super-comfy). Outer sole grip is limited on wet, slippery surfaces, though slightly better compared to Kanadia 7, which can be downright treacherous. Good value for this level of performance. For Christmas I got him a pair of another brand in 13W and they were too loose, so looking for another pair that would still run a little wider than normal these popped up and they fit the bill perfectly. So happy to not have to go shoe shopping at the store during the season. These shoes have a nice little heft to them and appear durable enough to withstand teenager shenanigans at least for a few months until he grows again. Love these. These have a firm sole but good balance. For running on trails or grass they are perfect. I also use them for running errands because they are so comfortable. Adidas has really improved in the past few years. I also like the style, particularly the orange color which is different enough that they really stand out. Pro:
-Traction works great for hiking in a bit slippery area.
-Sole support is better than expected.
-Quite comfortable and soft inside. Con:
-The size/shape is weird: I need to get half size larger than normal for the width to (barely) fit, but the length is too long instead.
-The back of the shoes does not properly grip the back of my feet and can easily slip out.
-Not very good air flow for hot days.
-The black color is more like dark grey.
-Thin shoelaces Great casual hiking shoe. Excellent soft rubber tread grips everything. Shoe is comfortable and light enough to be used as a casual running shoe. Great value. Well not with this seller. And it's my fault I should've looked and researched 1st but, I didn't and now its gonna cost me $19 to send back.. on top of the $80 I already shelled out. I love this shoe. Very light and the traction is awesome. The shoe is breathable, very comfortable to wear and comes in all sorts of colorways.

418	28	New Balance Summit Unknown	['Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'REVlite midsole', 'Rock Stop forefoot', 'FantomFit', '', '']	I was worried about the tongue because of other reviews and I did not like the feel of the tongue as I put the shoes on, but it held up great. The second run I did in then was a ten mile in very technical trails and they were excellent. Searched all over to find a good trail shoe for my relatively wide (size 2e) feet to use in my first Spartan rave. Visited a couple of running stores, REI, and bought 5 pairs here in Amazon. These were the only ones that fit, going up just half a size and getting the 2e wide size. The shoes were fantastic in the mud and on slippery trails. Great traction. Drained beautifully. These shoes fit as described, however my son and I were shocked at the complete lack of support in the shoe. We have had such good experiences with New Balance shoes in the past that we didn't even think to look at the insole. A change in shoe (thanks to a very helpful local running store) and he is back to running like his old self. On the plus side, if you're looking to remove the insoles and put your own in, these insoles remove easily and leave zero residue, making it quite easy to replace them. These shoes are great! they fit as expected. I wasn't sue how I would feel about the firm rubber strip that encircles the toe box but it doesn't bother me and I don't notice it when on my feet. These are another great offering from New Balance. Great trail and water shoe. Has inner sock liner that protected the bare foot from chaffing from the top of the shoe. Comfortable to be worn with socks or barefoot. Keeps my feet cool in the summer heat and humidity here in Key Largo. I work for a large scuba diving company. Got plenty of compliments on their style. I trusted Newbalance to make Wide shoes and have bought many pair of wide shoes from them over the years. The predecessor to this shoe is the Vazee Summit V2 which fits my wide feet perfectly. Looks like I will have to find my wide shoes from another shoe company. But very comfortable and my feet did not get hot hiking around Yosemite during 90 to 100 degree days. The tongue tends to slide down into the shoe, but it pulls back into place easily. Runs a bit small, but thinner hiking socks keep feet cool and improve fit. I have however always felt more comfortable in a wider shoe.These are a little narrow in the front for my taste. Periodically I get a little surprise rock pressure but not enough to bother me. These are very comfortable when not running and look pretty decent once you get used to the super hot color. Overall giving these a good rating (4star). If I would have bought a wider pair (4E), I these would be great for me.	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-Summit-Trail-Running/dp/B0751SLTSL?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B075297FH3&psc=1
419	29	Saucony Triumph ISO 3	['100% Engineered mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Technical running shoe with engineered stretch mesh upper and support frame heel counter', 'ISOFIT soft inner sleeve morphs to foot for sock-like feel', 'Everun insole provides responsive cushioning']	"Ive been running in Saucony for the past 10 years (ISO 1,2 & 3 and the Triumph prior). One thing about every pair Ive bought is that they have always been extremely comfortable straight out of the box. I thought maybe I just needed to break them in the for about a month now and theyre still very tight (and yes, I loosened the strings). The shoe looks very similar to the previous model but the fit is very different. After 3 pairs of this shoe version 2, moving to the iso 3, it is like the 2 but with the necesary improvements to be better. For the Iso 3, they fixed that defect and reinforced that area, so the shoes are perfect for me. I will never switch to another running shoe unless they discontinue the Triumph ISO. These are the best shoes I have found, they are light weight with plenty of cushion. The lacing used makes it feel like you are wearing socks. I was an Asics Nimbus fan which are great shoes, but after trying these will never go back. Hope this helps. They are better priced, and since they kept the naming / numbering convention, they were likely the last years model. I will say after trying each on, and running in both, the ISO 4's are definitely a better shoe. In fact, the Saucony's ISO3's have much more cushion than the Brooks Ghost's that I've been running in for the last three seasons (different pairs of shoes, but still more cushion), so that's definitely saying something. After a couple good runs, I'm starting to think it might have just been a breakin issue. I've now run 25 miles in this pair, and the pain points are now decreased to the point where I feel like they're going to definitely be the next shoe brand for me. It'll definitely be nice to be able to find another brand to switch on and off on because it keeps things interesting. These definitely run small - if you're going to do distance running, I suggest an entire size bigger than your normal shoe size. Read more I bought these shoes after trying on some Adidas Boost (did not like at all), Brooks, and Asics. They are by far the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned. I will likely buy a second pair, just to have them.

**Update: I have purchased a second pair, as well as a pair of Brooks Glycerins to try. If you are looking at this shoe for running please go a half size up as other reviewers have mentioned. I had purchased 5 pairs of the ISO 2 for the 2017 tranining / racing season all size 9, I ordered only 1 pair (size 9) of the ISO 3 to ensure a good fit only to find out they are definitely smaller than the previous model, I returned them and got the 9.5 and now have a perfect fit....Also, If you are new to the Triumph line these are a great neutral running shoe...Hope this helps. In my experience these shoes were wonderful up until around 225 miles. The construction and cushioning is spot on, but I'm coming to the conclusion that if you want quality runs change out your shoes on how they feel, not miles. I have a similar build to a strong safety that does a lot resistance training so when I hit the paths the abuse on the joints really gets noticed when the cushioning starts to wear. I wish these companies would provide extra insoles so you can get extra miles out the shoes instead of buying the cheap ones you have to cut yourself. I bought these without ever having tried them on before because I had tried on the newest model, the ISO 4, and really liked them in the store. But they cost $100 more and I took a shot that I would also love the ISO 3. They're good, but I had some issues to work out. First, the shoes fit tightly, especially if you want to swap out the insoles. Honestly, I didn't like them much at first. And I do use them and they are good shoes, once I got the lacing right."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Triumph-Running-Shoe/dp/B01GIKJGI2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01HSM5S22&psc=1

Great for walking and running, just don't expect them to be like a high-end shoe costing 3x what these cost. Excellent. Like I said, I bought 3 pairs. Cheers. This pair has to be worn with thin socks and even then the fit is tight.

As soon as I put these on, I could tell they had the potential to be the best shoe for me. I think I've found my perfect shoe company. I have somewhat higher volume feet, although my feet don't measure wide I tend to feel better in wide shoes from other companies. The Ultrafly has plenty of room in the toe box while keeping your heel and mid-foot very secure. The fit is very confidence inspiring. However, I am picky when it comes to fit, and a bit of a gear-geek in my activities. I've spent more money than I'm willing to admit on running shoes in the last 6 months, trying to find the ""right shoe"" (NewBalance 880, Asics Gel Kayano, Brooks Ghost, Brooks Revel, Saucony Guide ISO, Saucony Liberty ISO). Of those, the NB 880 and Saucony Liberty were the best I had. The NB 880 had a higher drop than I like as well as somewhat snug toe box. With the Saucony Liberty I had to size up to get room in the toe box, love the 4mm drop, the cushioning is firmer than I'm used to, and they feel a little long since I had to size-up. The Asics and both Brooks have too much drop for me 12mm, I feel like I'm running in high heels. The cushioning in the Ultrafly is more plush than Saucony Liberty, and similar to NB 880. Read more I have Morton's neuroma in one foot that makes it really hard to find a good running shoe. I also ran a 50k (trail, not technical) in them - my feet were the only thing that didn't hurt. They have a nice wide forefoot and great cushioning. It's hard to find a good shoe with a wide forefoot. These stay locked in on my heel better than Altras ever did. Read more I want to love these shoes. The sole and fit are great. If they redesign it with better materials in the upper it would be a great shoe. Read more I have a very wide forefoot and Topo's fit me like a glove. The fit is amazing for me. I'm a cyclist and not a serious runner but I went on several long runs in the Ultraflys and I thought they were amazing. I can't speak to durability but they appear to be well made. I'm a fan and it you have wide feet, I think you'll love them. Read more This was my first Topo Athletic purchase, and I'm glad I got them. They're very lightweight, and good for either walking or running. I recommend gradually breaking the shoes in before going several miles in a day. Read more I loved the altra impulse shoe.

Read more These Topo's fit really well and are very comfortable to wear all day long. Half size up fits well. I like mesh ventilation, solid bottom grip, big toe space, and less exotic color style.

428	8	Altra King MT	['Rubber', 'Rubber sole', 'Origin: Imported', 'Fit: True to Size', 'Insole: 4 mm Contour', 'Outsole: Vibram Megagrip Rubber', 'Upper: TPU/Ripstop Polyester']	They are a little bit heavier but I find they drain better and the rock guard is nice as well. The velcro strap does a good job of cinching down the mid foot without causing a hot spot. I'm giving them 5 stars, but really, they need to be dinged half a star for the way they outside of the pinky toe area wears-through super-fast. My last Altras were PERFECT, except for this. I sure hope it helps - it can't hurt, anyway. Otherwise, zero-drop is hard to find and extremely appreciated. The velcro strap, plus the steel ring at the base of the shoestrings, will be great for attaching race timing chips, no matter which kind is used. Excellent aggressive grip sole. The Altra shoes performed very good minimal slipping. They did not cake or clog up with mud like the other shoes did. Wider at the front giving you plenty of room. They dry pretty fast and cleaned up well post race. I recommend them for OCR races. I am well pleased with this product. After about 125 trail miles over one month, this shoe is one of my all time favorites. It is not an extremely minimalist shoe by any means, but does offer relatively low weight, neutral ride, good feel for the trail and stability, excellent traction and a reasonable amount of rock protection. Based on my experience and research, I think zero drop shoes are helpful for knee issues, and help keep the foot and entire kinetic chain in more neutral alignment. I know my knee feels much better since I've been using the Altra's, despite a significant increase in hiking/ running miles, and I expect to be running more again soon. The King MTs drain well and dry fast. I also have the Altra Superiors which are very similar, but traction in mud and on wet rock is much better on the MTs, and I prefer the slightly trimmer fit of the MT. And I have the Altra Lone Peak 3.5's, which offer more cushioning and a bit roomier fit. I think all 3 are great shoes, but the MTs are my personal favorites. That is what I ordered in the MT's, and they fit great for my preferences. I am used to more minimalist shoes, with soft flexible uppers that fit trim. Like those shoes, the MTs have a relatively soft and flexible toe, and minor toe contact on downhills has not been uncomfortable or caused any concern about black toe. People who like a roomier shoe may want to size up. Read more Bought these Feb 16 2018 for SPARTAN race season and alternated them with a dependable pair I used for 15 races...however, light and very comfortable to wear, especially combined with CATERPY laces, I ended up disappointed with the dexterity of the top shell...light material BUT far from durable. The top shell started tearing in NC June on a predominately flat course when met with wooded areas and foliage. Would love my money back or a new pair as it was used in no more than 7 races. First off, let me just state that I've been going through a lot of shoes looking for the right fit. These shoes hands down are the best. My passion is hiking and with the issues I was having with other hiking shoes like being too narrow, now enough tread etc..these shoes were a godsend. They seem to be holding up in some pretty tough conditions. Most of my hikes are in Hawaii in some pretty rugged terrain and lately, very muddy. These shoes are holding up just fine. Love these shoes!!. Excellent quality. The toe box on these trail shoes are designed to allow your toes to spread as you walk. Nice design. I wear a size 11D shoe and the size 11 I purchased fit as I expected. Extremely comfortable and it really did well in my first 7.3 mile savage race. First ever obstacle race and by the end my feet were the most comfortable part of my body. I have been having quite a few issues with arch support and neuropathy in the jo in my of my one toe and I can say these shoes really performed well and helped in those areas during the race.	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-AFM1752G-Mens-Trail-Running/dp/B01HNL1Q6U?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BJ64ZTN&psc=1

I have a wide foot (E) and they were still wide when ordered to my true shoe size. I am a 9.5 in every other brand but a 9 would have been best. Overall, the shoe performed well. Running down black diamonds was made as easy as possible with the stud pattern and the grip up walls was not an issue. It didn't add anything to the contact with the plywood but did not make it difficult either. I will say that if you do an ultra you may want more cushioning. I like the flexibility but that's just a personal preference. I am a fan of Merrells quality and have sandals and over the ankle hiking boots by them and figured Id give these trail running shoes a shot. Ive never been so relieved to remove a pair of running shoes. I have to watch this before I have a true opinion on the shoe's durability. They held up great. Did better than expected.

431	11	Altra Superior 4.0	['Fabric', 'Imported', 'Outsole: MaxTrac and TrailClaw sole', 'Ideal Uses: Trail running, trail racing', 'Cushioning: Low', 'Stack Height: 21mm', 'Weight: 7.9 oz. / 274 g', '', '', '', '', '']	"The shoe fits true to size. The toe box is huge, but that's why you're buying an Altra, right? (I put toe box as ""just right"" in the ratings, because it met my expectations for this shoe. I also love the weight, which is the lightest I've owned. However, the upper is super-thin even compared to more open meshes, so I think I'll use this shoe primarily in warmer conditions. I also love that the shape of the sole, the placement of the lugs, and the relief cuts all work together to encourage a smooth forward role of the foot with just a little snap or spring just before your toes lift at the end of your stride. However, the shoe uses a burrito wrap-style tongue in which the tongue is open on the outer side of the ankle, like a normal shoe, but attached on the inner side of the ankle. This makes the shoe a bit easier to enter, preventing the tongue from folding inwards and obviating the need to dig it out from under the laces. On the other hand, I found it difficult to dial in the fit as the top of the shoe would either rub against the inner side of my ankle or be too loose on the outer side of the ankle. With the roomy toebox this results in my right foot sliding in the shoe and hitting my pinky toe against the edge of the toe guard at the front of the shoe which helps provide loft/volume in the toebox (I do not have this issue with my left foot). I can mitigate the issue by wearing wool running socks like Darn Tough. I believe that the natural wool fibers provide a bit more friction against the insole to help prevent that sliding. Still happy with the shoe now that I've worked that out. The course was a dry and uneven surface with just a little muck and mud,,,, for that terrain, they were wonderful, comfortable and even shed the mud well with good enough traction. I will definitely use them for more races depending on the course as well as training. The wide toe box was comfortable and they actually appeard to drain well. Read more So I'm used to minimal running shoes and have been loving the Merrill Trail Glove for short - mid distance runs. I've been wanting something for longer runs and a friend mentioned he'd tried the Altras and loved the zero rise and wide toe box. Perfect length but I was concerned about the mid foot where the tongue connects. All in all, great experience and no fit issues. Excited to get more miles on these. If you're not used to barefoot or forefoot striking, it's likely best not to take them out for 20 miles on the first go. Happy Running. Read more I've bought 4 pairs of various Altra shoes including the Loanpeak 1.5, Superior 2.0, Escalante 1.5, and these. These are the best hands down. I love it all, the toe box, the tongue, the width, the energy return, the material on the the top layer, the extra notch at the top of the lacing, color, design, treads, it's all good in the hood. The only shoe I've ever owned that was better overall was the Brooks Cascadia 9 but that's a whole different animal. These shoes are the bomb. It hardly gets any better.

There is enough footbed protection that I don't have problems with small rocks causing discomfort and there is still a reasonable amount of ""feel"" for the ground. (For reference, the trails I'm usually on have good inclines and declines, small rocks, some mud (depending on the weather), cracks, tree roots, ruts; in other words, pretty much everything you would expect to find on a trail that didn't involve climbing or water.) If you really like the barefoot/minimalist shoe trend, these are a good starter transition shoe, or if you need the extra sole protection. If you're going to be on cleaner trails with fewer small rocks to step on, the Rushes are a great shoe as well. The Flashes are awesome, but only if you're on fairly smooth trails or you really enjoy feeling every rock that's a half-inch diameter or bigger. Read more I loved Merrell trail gloves 4 years ago - since then with Merrell's redesign, moved to Altra -- but decided to give Merrell another chance. I ordered several Merrell shoes to try them out (thanks Amazon Prime). The 8.5 was a good fit. The 8 was a good fit (perhaps even a little big), though more minimalist with less arch support. I found that adding my inserts to the Charges made too much arch support, given the built-in arch supports of the Charges. I wish Merrell offered different width shoes
Read more I'm between a 9 and 9 1/2 and the 9's fit me perfectly. My feet are a bit on the wider side and these fit me fine, although keep in mind, most of the other Merrell shoes tend to be wider than the All Out Charge. The grip on these are amazing. I got these for hiking, and on steep granite (in Yosemite), these shoes grip like glue. The heels on the All Out Charge fit tighter. I got these for $83 on Amazon. Yay.

I started with the Skechers GOrun 5 and loved those. It's a great lightweight shoe, and the cushioning is enough support for the longer runs without being heavy, and the support around the heel and ankle feels solid enough while still being soft. Good cushioning

Cons:
1. But I was still able to run comfortably. I don't like the sock upper, the elastic part that's supposed to hug around your ankle. It's not tight enough to feel like it offers any kind of stabilization.

3. I feel like if I tighten my shoe too much, it'll break one of those cloth pieces you thread the laces through. Overall a nice shoe, good for a beginner but I'd say it's good enough for seasoned long distance runners as well. It got me through the last half of my half marathon training and the actual half marathon event as well. Read more Firm responsive ride with good feedback and great energy return.

Read more I've been a huge fan of the Skechers lineup, having 3 pairs of GoRun 5 through my IRONMAN preparation over the past few years. The GoRun 6 fit a bit on the large size compared to the 5. I also found the one piece upper and lack of tongue took a bit of getting used to, but in triathlon transitions, I don't have to worry about the tongue getting folded over or out of place when I'm quickly slipping the shoes on. Overall, very happy with the comfort and cushioning of the shoes, and will continue to be a Skechers user. Shoes would be awesome if they were a little wider

They are also a bit pricey, but if you're a runner don't cut corners on your footwear. I needed a pair of stable, very cushioned shoes. My local running store recommended the Vomeros. I highly recommend them. My podiatrist recommended I get fitted for a good quality running shoe.

Read more At first was very excited about the shoes. Very happy with the 3.0 When talking or running in the 3.5 it rubs the tops of my toes. This is causing me to get blisters on the tops of my feet.

I am an over-pronator and these shoes make my foot strike feel solid and comfortable. Thanks Altra, you've made running painless and enjoyable again.

Customer support was awesome to work with. They went so far as to offer two additional models for replacement that better match the type of running I do. Changing from 3 stars to 5 because of the support, speed at while they assisted, the follow-up, and the genuineness of the people involved. I will definitely purchase Altra again, knowing they are this responsive and stand behind their products. This is my favorite shoe. The support is great for being on my feet all day at work, as well as for taking short to medium runs. They hold up well and fit as expected. Great, comfortable shoe. Shoe is comfortable. Very popular with the local triathletes. Only downside is that I am a heal striker and the shoe wears down pretty quickly. Popular styles appear to go fast. I have an extremely hard time finding shoes that fit me. Altra is one of the shoes that makes size 12.5 that actually fit me perfectly when a 12 is too tight and a 13 is way too loose.

The sole is hard enough to protect my foot, but soft enough to give me great traction, whereas most boots have a hard sole. And the fit is really comfortable. And i've bought all the big brands before Lowa, etc. but this boot is awesome and so is the customer service. Read more I've had several issues with the Roclite 315 and 320's shoes themselves and the company as well, so I will start from the beginning. First off, to get the sizes we need, we ordered shoes directly from Inov-8's website which advertised free shipping and free returns so I thought there wasn't much for me to lose. I didn't realize the company is based in the Uk, and after a day or two the shoes were shipped internationally with DHL with express 1-2 day shipping which was nice. I have a wide foot so I can understand why my size didn't fit, but my husband has never had such a problem putting on a 10.5 shoe before as he did with the Roclites. He gave it a try, looked at the shoe size to make sure he wasn't crazy, and went straight to the 11's. He was able to put on the 11's, but clearly felt that the shoe was too large for him length wise. Besides being narrow, the tongue of the shoe for both the 315 and 320 is mostly attached to the body, making the shoe and even tighter fit with minimal adjustability. Also, we both tried the 320's to assess the ankle support, and since my husband was the only one able to be able to put those on as well, he found the higher ankle of the 320 Roclite useless as it fanned out, providing absolutely no ankle support when compared to the 315's. Not the worst on the first order return, just a bit slow. From the original order date of 7/6 to arrival, it took less than a week. So I assumed that just like the last time, from receiving a return label to receiving my return, it would be about 1.5 weeks. We received the label and sent back the shoes, assuming all would be fine	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B077NZNQFN/ref=asc_df_B077NZNQFN1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B077NZNQFN&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Light as a feather, breathable, and stable, especially when having to make brisk turns and weight shifts on a flat surface concrete or plywood surface and working on the ball of your feet. The shoes are basically fine for casual wear but the cushioning at the ball of my feet while working is not what it once was when they were fairly new.

Nice looking shoe but it was way too small. I wear a mens 10.5-11 so I ordered a 44.5 (11) to err on the safe side. They feel like a size 9.5-10. I wish shoe makers would just stick to a standard.

Very good drainage though and very lightweight, which is what I was looking for. best trail shoe ever. easy on and off with the speed laces. even great to just take walk in. very sticky sole great in the rain too We really struggled getting the right size on these - had to send them back twice - third time worked. Otherwise they are great. Good traction and lightweight. Great lightweight shoe but they run SO SMALL! My 44.5 is tiny and I so wish I had returned for a 45 or bigger before wearing them outside.

As a person who weight 84kg, I wouldn't rely in this particular model to run regularly in, but they work excellent as a pair of casual ""kicks"" for mucking about. They lack the midfoot support other running shoes are designed with to prevent pronation. These are very comfortable. I wear them constantly because they are light weight and comfortable.

I will keep them as they are comfortable, but they are not as soft to the foot as previous models, especially pure grit 3s. The design of the back of the shoe looks like a senior citizen earth shoe.....ugh. I wore these shoes through my training and up through a Grand Canyon Rim2Rim2Rim hike/run. They are amazing -- very lightweight compared to my Solomon Speedcross, and the rock shield protected me from many a potential injury. I bought the exact same pair after my Grand Canyon shoes were retired. These are great shoes. With the puregrit 6 I have had perfect grip at all times. I also like the fact you can put your laces in a pouch at the top of the tongue - having dogs step on my laces is now a thing of the past. I really wanted to like these - cute colors, seems like good style. The 3's we're my favorites. Love how these feel on and have great support when I run.

The next day I used them for a Spartan Super run. They worked great trekking through mud, up steep inclines, wading through creeks, and climbing ropes. After the race they washed and dried like new. Great grip over rocks and wood. Would wear again for a short OCR. I road race in Saucony and thought these would be great. They were comfortable and definitely kept me from wiping out. The fit was good. Would have liked a TINY bit more room lengthwise, but sizing up would have been too much (I wear a sz 9). Toe box was perfect size. Bought these for work but they were too good looking to wear to work--at first. They look great and very comfortable and they finally made it to the work shoe rotation. And they are holding up admirably. Love this shoe. The 10 is great! not for wet concrete floors, but everywhere else is a no limits kinda thing. and soooo comfortable.

490	10	Saucony Zealot ISO	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Neutral cushion trainer featuring logo lace cage and supportive, customized fit', '4mm heel-to-toe offset', 'PWRGRID+ midsole cushioning', 'ISOFIT floating support cage', 'Weight: 8.3 oz']	"I was a huge fan of the Kinvara's and Cortanas. The sole: Like many of the new ""maximalist"" shoes, this model has a little more foam underfoot--especially around the arch. I feel like this gives to a true mid-foot strike, and a more solid feel when coming down hills. The tongue wraps into the internal liner of the shoe for a more secure fit. It is half-way attached on both sides (not like the ""burrito"" tongues that are only one side"". It has also noticeably minimized the lace sores on top of my foot on very long runs. If you liked the Cortana, love the Kinvara (but need more cushion), or want to try a very fast ""maximalist"" (high cushion with low 4mm drop) shoe that won't weight you down--I highly suggest the Zealot. I have tried multiple pairs from just about every major shoe brand and find that I like Saucony the best (with Brooks and a close second, but Saucony is starting to pull away). That being said, the Zealot is the best shoe I've put on in a long time, maybe ever. The fit is great, Saucony's fit my foot well to begin with and the Zealot doesn't let down. It is very light, but has great cushion. Perfect for the long days. They seem to be holding up very well. I will be more interested to see hoe the midsole holds up. Overall, I am very happy with these shoes I have worn about every brand of running shoe over the years, but have been largely a Brooks and ASICS runner. As a supinator, finding the right shoe can be tricky; for me neutral shoes have generally worked best, and out of curiosity I decided to try a pair of Saucony Men's Zealots in the lovely vizi orange, blue, and citron scheme. These fit perfectly right out of the box. One thing I immediately noticed and appreciated was the exceptional fit: the toe box is wide and comfortable and the shoes feel broken in from the first wear. I know it's a matter of personal preference, but the only slight critique I have is that I would have liked a bit more forefoot padding, but overall for the weight and fit I thought the cushioning was very good. While I tried these on a whim, I like them much more than I ever expected and they are now a steady part of my shoe rotation. I am genuinely grateful I found these shoes and can't imagine I won't look at Saucony more in the future. These are lightweight, flexible, and comfortable. This occurs with the original insoles and my own insoles barely help the problem. Other Saucony shoes, and all shoes and brands I've ever owned for that matter (athletic or dress shoes) I've had do not suffer from this. I'm only about 170 lbs and wear a men's 12.5, so I'm not straining the shoes. Maybe these are good for people with an underpronation or supination, but they aren't marketed that way, so it's your risk, but they may be great for that. They are comfortable (aside from the forced pronation), flexible, and lightweight (unfortunately?) because of such little rubber used on the soles. Read more These shoes fit like a glove. As soon as you put them, you want to run...and run fast. The only thing I don't love about them is that they are advertised as max cushioned on Saucony's website (which I'm sure they are), but they do feel a bit firm, so not sure how I'll feel about them on my longer runs (over 8-10 miles), but for any shorter, faster runs I would definitely recommend these shoes."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Zealot-Running-Shoe/dp/B00PIW0K0U?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00KPU1FXG&psc=1

These shoes are so awesome. Solid purchase once I found the right size. Love these shoes and this is my second pair but the first in the red. I normally wear a 8 1/2 but these fit small so you need to go up about half the size. So I got two size 9 they will fit a little snug just loosen enough where I'm around and they hold their shape really well. Im so happy I did. I ordered an 11.5 and they fit perfect and look even better. Im very happy with the purchase. The puck cushion under armour speaks of in the heel is a great feature for the change in run pattern up and down hills. The material is durable so I expect a solid 6months or more of use. The grips are great on the road and off. Only down fall I have encountered is they hold water/mud a little long than I'd like. I have tried a few different types of trail running shoes and these have been the best. They are made in a good balance. A hard enough outer sole to protect your foot with plenty of foam for a soft landing. Also, I have been using these for Tough Mudders and Spartan Races, and they are amazing. The dry fast, do not hold mud like other shoes, and the tread works great in changing environments. Best trail shoes I have used, and I will stick with them for a long time. Got these for the Spartan Beast , really glad i did (my Nike trail runners were too narrow and light tread. I needed a pair of shoes with good tread on them so I could compete in missed events. Found these and loved them. Ive always loved underarmour shoes and have had great experiences with them. These feel a little bulky at first but I hope they will feel better once I wear them in. I ordered it just because I need a good shoes when I go to Arizona. I read from previous reviews and even on UA mobile site that this shoes run a bit smaller so you should pick a size 1 level higher from your actual foot size.
::How I determined the size: I measured my foot from the ball to the tip of my longest toe using a tape measure. Lol
::Function: I used the shoes for hiking (see photos). Honestly, I like it cause it didnt give me any foot pain (for all those who are flat-footed, you can relate!) because I believe this is meant for rugged terrain too. So this shoes survived a 3 hours hike.

495	15	New Balance 510 v3	['100% Leather/mesh upper', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'IM ethylene vinyl acetate midsole', 'Memory top comfort insert', 'AT tread outsole. PU sockliner']	"First let me address the fit. For instance I wear a size 10.5 M, based on other reviews I ordered a size 11, and am I glad I did. The 11's fit me well, the width is good, but the toe area is about what I would expect n a 10.5, not size 11. So as others have said, order a 1/2 size big and you'll be ok. I have other NB shoes that fit at 10.5, but these seem to run small. Now as for comfort, I waited till after a couple several mile hikes before reviewing, but these shoes are in fact very comfortable and lightweight, and for NB a very good value shoe. I wear them on hikes through the woods where I walk on everything from sand, to tall grass, to clay, and these shoes did great. The only reason I knocked a start off was for the size issue, but if you know going in to order a 1.2 size up, you're good. Would recommend. I have been wearing New Balance shoe products for many years,including cross trainers and walking shoes as well as golf shoes.This was the first time that the shoes did not fit properly.I wear a 10.5 US size in 4E.I have purchased Nike as well in their wide size.The New balance usuall fit better and don't squeak on hard flooring.I ordered this pair just prior to a trip to North Carolina that I knew would entail lots of walking.When they arrived I could barely get the left shoe on and the right one felt like a vise.I actually measured the shoe bottoms against the ones I was currently wearing and they were clearly shorter and the real puzzle was why the two different widths.Bothe were marked with the 10.5 tags.I sent them back to Amazon the next morning.Should have believed some of the prior reviewspointing out the problem but some reviewers stated they fit just fine.Amazon shipped new ones right away but I left for my vacation before they arrived.The new ones were here when I got home and a quick check shows that the 11.0 4E will suffice but I haven't had a chance to walk around yet.I like the style and color and hope they work.I strongly recommend that Amazon discontinue the sales of this model.New balance needs to get the quality control team into the plant where these are made so their reputation isn't further sullied.I might not buy footwear thru Amazon again without 100% positive reviews as to size. these are made as well as any other new balance product. the fit MUCH tighter that the newbalance sneakers of the same size they are replacing. it makes them very uncomfortable. consider going up a size. While this pair fits as hoped, it took three tries to get there. After ordering two new pairs of size 11 and returning them, the third and final pair was ordered a half-size larger (11.5 vice 11) and finally felt comfortable. Either my feet are growing or NB is producing smaller sized shoes, so buyers beware that NB's newer shoes may run small. Other than the fit, I like the new 510v3's flat laces which break from NB's traditional round ones that never stayed tied. While the flat laces may be old school, it apparent that flat laces are designed that way for good reason - they remain tied. I am beginning to favor practical design over cool. Overall, once I found my correct NB size, the shoes are very comfortable. In fact, my last pair of NB's were designated ""walking"" shoes and did not have the heal and arch support of these ""Trail Running Shoes"". I needed something cheaper as well because of financial concerns. I FINALLY found a color that is acceptable to a 'more senior' man. I love New Balance shoes. For the last 17yrs or 18yrs, I have worn a size 11 regular, so I was surprised at how snugly these fit. Thankfuly my feet were ok after I took them off at the end. This was actually the first time I had ever bought shoes online before, and thanks to this, I probably never will again either!"	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-510v3-Trail-Running/dp/B0164A1V52?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B015XJSXEC&psc=1

I normally wear a 6 to 6-1/2 but due to helpful reviews I ordered a 7...glad I did, as it is a perfect fit. I like these shoes for the comfort, tread, and looks. Never tried Under Amour before now, and I am hoping they will last longer than my last pair of Sketchers, which I loved for their looks, but the sole wore down in less than a year. These Shoes Developed a hole in the top of one shoe. Shoes never abused, just walked in. They fit but If given the same circumstances, I would purchase a better shoe. The fit is snug but not overly small. They are comfortable, so 2 stars for that. I wore these shoes brand new to Disney for 8 days without any problems. Very comfortable shoe. Recommend buying 1/2 size bigger than your normal size. Comfortable, stylish, and light. Definitely affordable. Great shoes. I loved the shoe, but they run small. I normally wear a 6.5-7 so I ordered a 7 (after reading reviews about how they run smaller) figuring it would be great. Other than that, I love them because they are SO light (I tried walking around in them for a bit) and cute. Probably the most comfortable shoes I have ever bought. I was a little hesitant on getting them because of the price, but I am extremely happy that I did. These are my favorite shoes to wear while working a 12 hour shift. Better than pictured online. Under Armor fits as expected, for me, and I was soon comfortably walking around. The toebox is wide enough and leaves enough room to make them quite comfortable.

I also love the black colorway. The shoe fits true to size for Adidas, which for me is a 9.5. The width is ok, but there is some room above my toes. For most people it would probably be a snug fit, and the material seems like it would be stretchy enough to accommodate bigger feet. The best feature is the full length Boost. It's the best cushioning system out there for running, and I can't believe I got it for such a low price. It feels like you're running on pillows and it doesn't break down like other cushioning systems. The upper is nothing special, but it is comfortable and fairly breathable. It's not like Primeknit, but for a mid-priced shoe it's very good. The description says it's a stable running shoe. For what I'm doing, I like the flexibility, but I think a hard core runner might want a shoe with a torsion system like they have in their more expensive models. If I paid full price, it would still be a good deal, but I'd probably knock it down to 4 stars. Read more There really nice Adidas.

Very comfortable in the step and while running, however, the left shoe seemed a bit too narrow for my left foot, while the right shoe felt just fine on my foot. I paid $61 for these... very nice comfort technology for such a decent price. Thank you seller. Thank you Adidas. Thank you NASA!

Not as good as the super high end $170 boost technology, but absolutely life changing for foot comfort.

In fact I'm getting another pair, even tho these haven't worn out yet but they are so comfortable. The local shoe selection is pretty slim, so I was forced to take a chance on ordering shoes online and purchased these strictly for running. They're super lightweight, one of the most comfortable shoes I've owned and to top it off they even look pretty good. If they maintain well against the wear and tear, the next shoe could quite possibly this same shoe. They dont have great shock absorption, not bad but i have better as well. Id probably go for a slightly better pair of under Armour shoes next time. The shoes fit as expected for US sizes and they are very comfortable shoes and durable. I wear these shoes while I work in the office or in the field, playing sports such as soccer. Put about 50 miles into them so far and have been loving them. Needless to say my feet got wet as expected but they kept up lovely and didn't lose too much traction on the wet rock like I assumed they would. Putting these on my feet made me feel like the incredible hulk as he starts to turn green. I originally found these shoes to fit somewhat small, but after wearing them in a little, they fit perfect. I have received quite a few compliments on these shoes for looks. The transition into the UA shoes was very easy.

Starting from the bottom, The treads have good grip. The treads are in no way showy, but that's a good thing. Finally the shoe laces are a little strechy which allows easier insertion. You won't be able to mash your foot in these and just magically slip them on, but they're not difficult by any means. Once on, they feel like a light hug all around the foot. Size is perfectly in line with the last New balance pair, the 520 V3 I have a lot of sneakers and I was very impressed by my first pair of NB's. They fit perfectly and that means they will feel very snug the first time you put them on - you may even think you ordered the wrong size, but stick with it, once you get them on you will be wearing a very comfortable, well fitting shoe that in my opinion is equally as good for runner as it is for training (a rare combo). It has great side wall support as well as a solid bottom tread that holds the floor for heavy weightlifting (and still provides arch support. I am wearing a full size larger than my normal size and they now fit very good.

508	28	Saucony Redeemer ISO	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Width denoters: D (Medium), E, 2E (Wide), 3E (X-Wide),']	"The first thing I noticed is that due to the wider toe box of the ISO redeemer, I was able to go back to my true shoe size, rather than going up a half size as I recently had done with the other brand. For me these required less effort for toe-off during that phase of the gait cycle, which was beneficial. The support is good, but they seemed to be a little more flexible, which I grew to like. The cushioning is very good. Overall I'm pleased with the shoe and have stocked up. Some reviews of it appear to not be quite as favorable as this original Redeemer. This shoe is truly as close to a therapeutic shoe that you can get. Let's be clear: It is RIGID as a piece of granite. It's comfortable but you really can't flex the foot. It's better than the BEAST. Again, talk to your physician or therapist before buying. If other people want to take a chance, they could try a half size larger than normal. I will return these shoes to Amazon and go to my Podiatrist's office where they sell Vionics and make sure I get a shoe that fits properly. They certainly can't get longer. I switched over to these after Saucony discontinued the best shoes I've ever ran in the Stabil CS3. After numerous emails back and forth with a Saucony rep, I was assured the Redeemers would fit the same as the Stabils, wrong. I usually get a 12 2E in Saucony shoes, the toe box of the Redeemer is way too wide, probably closer to a 3E. Shoes seem a lot heavy too, at the end of a 7-8 mile run my legs feel like I've been doing squats for an hour. Awesome fit and comfort. Most comfortable motion control shoe I've tried and true to fit. Asics tend to be a little snug in the toes and Brooks were loose in the heel these were perfect. I can walk miles and even run in these without pain. So comfortable and so supportive, I wish every shoe I had felt like this. You can be on your feet all day with these and it's better than anything else I've ever had. These also fit custom orthotics very well though you'll have to run some light grit sandpaper over the plastic parts of the orthotic as mine seem to squeak against the synthetic fabric of the inside of the shoe unless I do this periodically. These shoes are great. Heavy frame runners (185lbs or more) with flat or low arches who like to run should definitely invest in some good motion control shoes to help prevent stress fractures and shin splints. I've used the Brooks Beast series for the last few years and I think these shoes are just as good if not better. The Redeemers actually fit a little better than the Beasts, I always had issues with my pinky toe rubbing on the side of the shoe and wearing out the side stitching, plus the bottoms of my Beasts have always worn out too fast. The size tool that Saucony provides is really accurate, I wear a size 11 wide in Brooks and these shoes fit just fine in the same size. These shoes are comfortable, light weight for a motion control shoe, provide outstanding support, and I would highly recommend them.

He loves Nike shoes because they are the brand of choice among his peers, but none of the last few pairs of Nikes he has had have lasted more than 4 months, and these only a few weeks. I get that an active teen is tough on shoes, but any shoe at this price point ought to last longer than this. My white pair were getting a little dirty but I loved them so I picked up a pair in black. Lightweight and comfortable. You cant go wrong with these. Great for running, the Gym, most Athletics. I like these a lot. Similar but probably a bit more comfortable than the Lunarglides I own. These also look pretty cool. They look like they are black in pictures but are really kind of a iridescent dark blue/green. Perfect for S Florida. He saw these shoes in a popular shoe store but I found them $20 cheaper here on Amazon.

511	1	Adidas AlphaBounce CK	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Imported', 'adidas']	"The alphabounce are the perfect shoe. Incredibly comfortable and lightweight. The colorway is beautiful. Sizing is spot on! *Note: I take pictures with the flash on & off so you can see what it looks like either way* the circular knit upper is softer and more strechy than that of a standard forged mesh alphabounce, but not as breathable as the engineered mesh version. The bounce cusion is conformfortable as usual, not especially soft, but respensive under your feet and the kind of thing you could wear all day without feet getting sore. The shoe fits confortably true to size, with ample room for toes and though the midfoot. The Upper doesn't give excessively above the midfoot, causing your foot to leave the sole of the sneaker, so you should be able to lace your shoes to the desired tightness without worrying about slim slipping while running. The circular knit upper, while comfortable is not enough so to forego wear with socks. Overall, alphabounces are great pairs of sneakers, especially at thier frequently discounted price point. I've been running as a little hobby for a number of years and go through a fair number of shoes. This is probably one of the best running shoes I have used. The cushioning provides one of the best impact absorption levels I've experienced. The glove-like upper unit hugs the feet like I've not experienced previously and the ""breath-ability"" of the fabric has maintained a cool and dry in-shoe experience. The shoe is also lightweight which helps with my older legs. Terrific shoes ... congratulations Adidas for a solid design and performance shoe. This is a very comfortable walking shoe. I like the men's walking shoes from Adidas much better than the women's because they're more comfortable and they give you more length. for someone who has long, narrow to medium with feet, it's a bit of a challenge to find comfortable walking shoes in women's styles. It's also very good quality material and a very pretty color. Good buy. All reviews said this was a great shoe and maybe it is. Nice color exactly as per picture. Fits perfectly. Good design and very light also. Definitely recommend this. There are only two effective levels of laces. This is not the shoe you want if you add an insole for arch support or prefer a shoe that you can work the tongue and laces for a better fit. I love my first pair so much that I bought these for when the first wear out. I wear dress shoes all week and the cushion in these is so comfortable while not looking like a pair of grandpa shoes."	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Mens-Alphabounce-Running-Shoe/dp/B071LFJ1NP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07KWGQ8SM&psc=1
512	2	New Balance 510 v4	['fabric-and-synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Heel Kick', 'Injection Molded EVA', 'Leather/Mesh Upper', '', '']	"For the price this is a great pair of shoes. I've been wearing loafers from Sketchers for years but recently I started running and need something with better cushion for my heels at work during the day. I love the shoes as they are light, gives good traction and looks appropriate for work day. It became a lovely and comfortable pair of shoes to help cushion my heels on standing at work. I love it so much I even bought a second pair. I want to say, at the outset, that I'm a Saucony guy. By the end of a mile's walk, I could tell that the footbed was breaking in, and the shoe was more comfortable. They worked great. Where the Sauconys left my feet sore from the rocks poking up, the NB's distributed the shock of sharp stones over a greater area and I was comfortable. In general, the road isn't particularly kind to my knee, but these NB's are a winner for trails. They're a bargain. Pros: They are comfortable (like most New balances)
They are CHEAP (paid >$60)
Cons: No traction, they are okay on dry ground/floors but if there is any water BEWARE! Even old concrete sidewalks felt slick with a little rain. The shoe is made out of a very thin cloth, which is great for keeping you feet dry but if you step in a puddle, the shoe will get soaked and your foot will be drenched. Also there's no support for your foot since it's so thin. But they were only about $50 so I can't complain much. Very comfortable and lightweight for a trail running shoe. Rubber toe protector is nice to help keep dew off and protect from debris. Good traction. Arch support is minimal, but I wear custom inserts so it wasn't an issue for me. The soles can be easily removed and replaced, if necessary. I haven't water tested them but with a mesh top, I don't believe these will have any water resistance. Overall, I would recommend these. I absolutely loved the 510v3 I bought early this year. Best described as running on foam covered planks of wood. Zero love for these for running. I suppose they'll do for casual wear with jeans. Very comfortable footbed and great for walking or sports. The shoe is adequate. The toe says ""toe protect"" but not sure what that means as it's pretty much like any other new balance shoe. The insole that comes with it is pretty bad though and lacks pretty much any support. Definitely needs an aftermarket insole. The fit is nice and it fits on my medium sized feet very well. A lot of other shoe manufacturers assume that because you have long feet (size 15) that your feet are also super thick. These fit very well across the metatarsal and I don't have to since them up just to hold my foot snug."	https://www.amazon.com/New-Balance-510v4-Cushioning-Running/dp/B07B6ZFPN2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07Q7M1B3P&psc=1

Designed to improve running form, toe splay, stability, push-off, traction, and comfort. NeoShell® uppe']	"I've searched high and low for the magic pair of boots that let me cover ground fast and efficiently, and will allow me to get the miles I need on a long day with mixed terrain. Well, I've found them. The boots that are going to get me through all of the conditions of this summer's JMT trek through hot days, but also allow me to across the snowy and icy high passes. I have now put just over 50 miles on these shoes, and I'm so highly impressed that I had to share my excitement. That's right. 15% improvement by only changing my shoes. My feet are so much stronger, and I'm landing more mid-foot than I ever have in my life. Huge toe box. Your toes can really spread out, which gives you significantly improved balance. This is where my downhill time has really improved because I'm much more balanced than with any of my other boots. The tread faces towards your heel on the front half of the shoe for great uphill grip, and the tread faces forward on the heel half of the shoe which grips the downhills. The big squishy sole is like walking on pillows, but with stability. Nothing but pure control with comfort. And they're strong enough to fit a set of K10 crampons without flexing at all. Ankle padding is pretty darn thick. After 50 miles, it hasn't even broken down yet, so I put these on and they feel like new. I can even lace these up rather loosely, and the support is still great. With all of my low hiking shoes, I had to lace up pretty darn tight and do the ankle lock lacing trick to keep my feet from shifting forward on downhills. I haven't had that issue on these shoes because the ankle area is so much more supportive and takes less lace tension to keep them in place. The circulation in my feet has been fantastic in these. The built-in velcro gaiter traps on the backs of the heels allow you to secure your Altra or Dirty Girl gaiters without having to glue anything to your shoes. The toe area of the laces has a metal wide loop to clip the front hook of your gaiters to as well. Dirty Girls do fit over these shoes perfectly. For a pair of mid height boots, that's damn good in my book. They have to be perfectly clean to be waterproof. My shoes will never be clean, so I'm not expecting these to handle any kind of saturation without wetting through to my socks pretty quickly. That's great news for blister prevention. But hey, if they do help keep my feet a little more dry during stream crossings, trudging through some snow, and during rain, then it's just a bonus. Not a single fray or tear, and they are breaking in nicely. Read more Being my first pair of Altras I was unsure of how they would fit, how they would perform, and how they would fair in the implicit ""wet conditions"". This advice was invaluable, bc they fit perfectly for me, a half-size up from my normal size. I recently ran a 10K race w/ 1700'+ elev gain and it was super wet the day after a good rain. If you think the extra support will be beneficial for you, these are a good pair to consider. The runners were exactly what I wanted, with the zero drop with wider to box: basically the exact things Altra advertise as the benefits of their products. Were I to have 'normal' sized feet these would probably be fine, but I reviewed them as they fit my foot. First off, the fit is incredibly comfortable, and I immediately knew I was going to be a fan of the brand. The waterproof-ness was a big draw for me, and I'm definitely impressed. None. ""Wet conditions"" are listed in the product description for these as somewhere the shoes excel, so I feel the need to share how I've experienced it. I relied on my knees instead of my feet for scrambling up rocks and boulders along a river, resulting in plenty of fun bruises. These were amazing when back on the trail, but I would consider being able to traverse wet rocks important for someone in the Pacific Northwest. I love the toe box and the zero drop, but I am feeling like I won't be able to use these on as many trails as I was hoping, so for the price, I would rate this about 3 or 3.5 stars, personally. If I had paid less and expected just to wear them around town, it would have been an easy 5. I love the shoes but cannot tell what I am going to get. I do like the mid very much it provides that little added bit of support while still being very comfortable."	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Lone-Trail-Running/dp/B01B71ZQRW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FEB98L6&psc=1

They are nice looking and comfortable running shoes, as I am on my feet for eight hours at the airport terminal. They are a good buy for the price. They are totally black, so they look nice with a uniform. So far so good but time will tell if they will hold up or not. These are nice looking shoes but have very little padding in them which is fine for me. But just like most UA shoes you should size up. I normally wear 13-13wide but ordered size 14 and they fit perfectly. Hope they wear well. The other shoes were right and fit well. The ringer tee shirt is of good quality and fit well. Good shoes and they look good, just wish I had went another size up. They're comfortable, they wipe off reasonably easily. These shoes are super comfortable right out of the box.

Love the lacing system but the place on the tongue where you stuff the excess is kinda hidden. I don't think the soles will last long on pavement but on natural terrain I can see them lasting longer. I bought them specifically for dirt/gravel and they grip like a monkey's paw. Very well crafted, great fit and good looking. i've been wearing these shoes for ocr events (spartan race, goruck, etc.). for spartan races, once you've done a couple, you start to realise that it's good to wear actual ocr shoes like these. they grip well, do well on the hills (the california spartan race venues have lots of hills), do well in mud and water... the lace system is great. for some reason, when i have traditional laces on shoes (any kind of shoe), they are always coming untied. this kind of lace system can't come untied. i like wearing these shoes when i'm on trail runs too.... also, i tend to wear them when i'm just going off to somewhere muddy. Awesome looking, and great feeling shoe. I agree with others, in the way of fit; runs a little small. They fit perfectly, without being too tight. I also agree with the heel being a little loose, as others mentioned. I'm happy with them overall, despite not yet hitting the trail. A few rainy walks with my dog, have me feeling pretty good about the traction. I'm no extreme sports guy, but I'd say this is a well built, very capable trail runner. Out of the box, they didnt feel like the Speedcross I was used to, but I kept them anyway. I walked 5 miles straight out of the box with a spring in my step again. I was a bit concerned with the shoe fit since that is something people find as an issue with these shoes (especially the speedcross 3s), but the shoe fits perfectly. For most shoes/brands Im an US size 8-8.5 and I ordered these ones 8.5 and I still have a bit of room for my toes which is good to have for when your feet starts to swell. I use these shoes for hiking and they feel lightweight and with an excellent grip. Also, the shoe lacing system is a nice feature; you can take them off and back on super quickly. Overall, I love hiking with these shoes and I know I can put a few hundred miles on these bad boys. These trail runners give you a great amount of confidence on technical trails. The lacing system is great for quick lacing and adjustment when your in the move. I love these shoes. These are very good competition trail shoes. They have the best rock protection of any light weight trail shoe I have used. They also have very good cleat action which makes them tops for traction of all the shoes I have tested. They fit very well and have great down hill fit inside the shoe to prevent your toe from hitting the box. Had to return because my husbands heels kept slipping out of the shoe- moreso on the left, though they fit everywhere else. We were bummed to return them because they look and feel good otherwise.	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-Speedcross-Trail-Runner/dp/B01N2KIR4T?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01J3YNJY2&psc=1

I really like that the outsole has uniform tread and cushioning, especially in the arch. Had these shoes for about 3 months now and I can say not only are they durable but they still look good. I have fallen arches and these shoes offer great support and dont deform with the extra pressure on the sides. There is however some slight wear on the top mesh that could potentially get bigger. This showed up after a wash in the washing machine so I would recommend washing these by hand. I will say that I have been pretty rough on these so I would expect them to be showing some signs of wear. Not so bad that Ill return it. Very comfortable shoes. We'll see how well they hold up. Kind of disappointed because theyre very comfortable and they look good. But they dont seem like theyre going to last much longer. Great running shoe.

I replaced the wack neon orange laces with some $8 flat dark green laces from Amazon. Not sure about kickin down doors but your ju-jitsu and foot pursuits will increase by 9,000.

It looks as expected and the surface material held together well. The sole is very flexible, as advertised, but they don't tell you that it also stretches over time. The best shoe I've had in ages. This is such a great, comfortable, stylish and flexible shoe. I've tried many other minimal/barefoot shoes - some of which I've quite liked, none of which I've loved - and this is hands-down my favorite. They are extremely comfortable (considering they are a minimal shoe with an inevitable lack of cushiness), and fit just as I'd expect and are nice and wide in the front leaving plenty of space for the toes to spread out as they naturally should. As someone who has some degree of foot discomfort/plantar fasciitis, this has been very welcome. They are also very well constructed, at least after several weeks worth of use, which hasn't been the case with some other Vivo shoes I've owned in the past. My only wish would be that they would offer them in other colors too. The blue wouldn't have been my first choice, but fortunately it's rather dark and quite close to black as another reviewer commented, so it's pretty neutral and doesn't clash with black or grey pants. I would love to see this shoe in other color options too such as black, grey, browns, army green, etc as well. I'm pretty sure I would purchase them all if they were tasteful. But this is an all around fantastic and unique shoe which I hope they continue to make for many years to come. Read more Awesome. This neutral shoe can allow you to wear them with anything in the wardrobe and they feel amazing!!!. These fit me great. The leather is good quality and the color is a deep navy blue. Now I have the BEST SHOES ever!. I absolutely love these. Amazing shoe. I just wish I had known to buy a half size to small. The shoe will stretch marginally that makes for a suboptimal fit. I am a big fan of Vivobarefoot shoes, this is the fourth pair that I have purchased.

UPPER: Abrasion-resistant mesh with minimal seams.', '', '']	"Its not often I write negative reviews, but my hands are tied. The shoes are very comfortable and breathe extremely well but the sole has already begun to separate from the upper. Despite quite a bit of online searching, I have been unable to find any good medical, postural, or anatomical reason why any footwear should have an elevated heel area. Seems like the practice began long ago when men wanted to look taller than they were and ultimately everyone got conditioned and used to heels that were at least somewhat elevated. But I don't discount those who point out that an unnatural extra half-inch or more under the heel can throw off natural gait and posture significantly. My first zero drop shoes were Altra Lone Peak 3.0 low tops in a bright color that was not my preference for hiking, though the shoes were extremely comfortable once I became conditioned to the lack of an elevated heel. I emailed Altra and suggested that they make a more neutral colored version especially suited to hiking, given the number of long distance thru hikers who were gravitating to Altra products. I doubt it was the result of my suggestion, but I was very glad to see the mid-height Altra Lone Peak 3.5 shoes come out in tan color and with higher tops. Looked like just what I'd asked for and thus I had to order a pair to try on mountain trails. The new mid-height 3.5's are very comfortable and easily wide enough for me though not designated as a size ""wide"". A combination that makes it easy to slip, sort of like walking on marbles on a hard floor. I was probably making the descent faster than was wise. Not necessarily a bad thing. But these Altra Mid 3.5's are the best and most comfortable footwear I have found so far for the mountain trail conditions that I encounter most commonly. The traction is great which is highly important. The non-waterproof feature is an absolute must for me as I like to allow my feet to dry out after walking through a creek instead of slopping around in a GoreTex membrane for hours on end. The shoes are comfy and fit well albeit a bit small; would go 1/2 size up. Offer lots of cushion, but a bit like walking on a water balloon off trail. I have a pair of ten year old size 12 casual shoes (Merrells) that still fit me with plenty of room. But over the last two years I have had to by a solomon 13w, size 11 xero cloud sandals (fit perfectly. Love these sandals), and if i were to do it over I would have bought a size 14 in these lone peaks. One thing I did find is that if you look for the European size (size 47 in my case) you have a much better chance of getting a proper fit on the first try. I followed what other reviews said about size and I ordered up a half size and I am very happy with the size. With that being said, these are THE best boots I have ever had on my feet. When I put these boots on, I cried they felt sooooo good. I Love the wide footbox and the Zero-drop is wonderful. I love to just wear them. They make me want to hike like no other boot I've owned. Thank you Altra. Great for all day hiking. I would have preferred one size larger to allow a little more room. The 2nd is one half size larger and fits perfectly, and these would have fit perfectly if one whole size larger. Although snug, they are still great, and they will certainly get a lot of wear and use. Lightweight, comfortable, breathable, and right in style."	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Lone-Peak-Mesh/dp/B01MU35G1E?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MUCM5VF&psc=1

I'm very happy Loved these so much I bought a second pair. Went to SE Asia last month and these wewre amazing while hiking / walking 5-10 + miles a day, day after day. Really like this shoe for trail running and general ""offroading"". I wore this for a 12 hour Spartan race event and they were great. The fit was strong enough to stay on my foot through slogs and slogs of mud, but loose enough so that my feet didn't go numb with heavy movement (like a 3 mile ruck run through a corn field). When they aren't covered in gunk they look pretty good too. Nice looking shoes (black-neon green), good grip, great for short runs. I stepped up my workouts and using these on the elliptical, treadmill, and significant walking/jogging on paved surfaces. Overall i really like them, they are a little snug but that was to be expected and what i wanted. I do like the support and they are meeting all expectations for my use. Another plus was the color; I like yellow athletic shoes. Love adidas, own every pair generation of vigors. First time i put them on wanted to send back, glad i didnt few hours wearing them around house i didnt want to take them off. Feet stay warm and dry and my socks are never wet or sweaty. I wanted the vigor 6 but I couldnt find any my size so I tried these out. I would like to see maybe a toe cap on this shoe to make it better. The traction is great on hardwood, linoleum, tile, concrete, dirt, rocks, just about everything really even fairly decent grip on wet granite until you find a mossy spot. I liked the vigor 6 rubber soles better they seem to last longer with the bigger lugs that were very reminiscent of a bmx bike tire tread where as these have the smaller lugs and they are wearing down faster. I was hoping for an upgrade to a great shoe and got a near miss, i want the vigor 6 back, these are not an improvement. Read more I love those sneakers. They offered very good support and traction on all kinds of terrain. I like the wider heal too, definitely helped over uneven surfaces.

But it is definitely there, I can flex my toes and hear and feel the plastic crinkle. nbd to me.

3. But on these shoes, it feels like that scooped out part is too far back and my ankle bone is rubbing on the front. I am going to hope this will go away after a breaking in period. (I'll put in a pic to show the ankle bone thing)

4. Like it lifts out of the back and the shoe doesn't come up with the heel at first. Not a major big deal but less than ideal. The shoe fits nice and snug everywhere else and I wouldn't want a smaller size. Okay, that's it for the cons, now to PROs:

1. Nice build: Looks great, feels real snug w/ the lacing system which is fast and secure. Also just feels like a real solid shoe, well insulated and built tough. (this could be a bonus for anyone wearing them in cold weather, but it rarely drops below 50F here, even in the winter.) Good support. Bottom tread feels grippy and looks like it will last.

2. Price isn't bad ($100) for a quality shoe, esp when lots of others are in the $150-$250 range these days. Product support by Salomon is repair/replace for first 400 miles, or so I've been told. Plus Amazon has a great return policy, which I am going to utilize now to trade these in and get a NON- waterproof/GTX/Gortex pair in hopes they will be cooler (temperature wise)

I hope this review helps you get the right shoe for you. If you have a question I will try to answer it. :D gl

Oh yeah, SIZING: I normally wear a men's 11 (I am male); I ordered a men's 11 and it feels just right, with just a little bit of extra room in the toe. Read more Salomon's XA Pro 3D CS has been my go to trail shoe for a number of years. The salomon XA pro 3D are a fantastic shoe for almost any activity. Ive been using mine for about 4 months now and I have not found any complaints. The 11.5 was a great choice. My two favorite things about these shoes are the drawstring laces and the waterproofing. The laces are incredibly easy, quick and durable. I think half the reason I wear these everyday is because theyre so easy to put on. For the past two weeks Ive been wearing these in the snow and they are great. My feet have stayed warm and dry the entire time. I am slightly concerned for the summer with breathability but I love them so much Im considering purchasing a second pair that isnt waterproof for then. Overall I would completely recommend these to anybody with an active outdoor lifestyle. Ive put these shoes through the ringer and still look as good as they day I got them.

(PSA- if you are purchasing these for use on set, I would recommend wearing them for a bit beforehand. The material is pretty loud when initially wearing them but after about two weeks they broke in.)
Read more These are really great shoes, for Spring and Fall hiking. I was very skeptical of the quick lace system but now I really like the system. They're very comfortable out of the box, and I've been using them around town when the weather is wet or some snow on the ground. The fit is perfect and I use a medium weight Winter sock. They look good too, for what's it worth. I have had a version of this shoe for ten years and love them. Waterproof and very comfortable. The laces make it very easy to put on. To be on the safe side order them in three sizes. They were great shoes so I was looking to replace them with a similar shoe. The toe is less robust and the shoe is lighter and a bit less rugged. More rugged, a bit more like a light hiking shoe than a runner. I tried the standard XA pro, the XA Pro CS WP (water proof), and the XA Pro GTX (goretex) and liked the CS WP best. The standard XA breaths great but is not waterproof. The CS WP is a perfect compromise."	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-Waterproof-Trail-Runner/dp/B01HD6R2AE?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01J3ZDA2M&psc=1
534	24	Nike Free RN Distance	['fabric-and-synthetic']	These are great running shoes. Light and feels strong. I've used them for a week now so I don't know how long they will last but they are great for running 6 to 8 miles at a time so far. I bought these shoes in the midst of working 60 hour weeks during the 2017 peak season at Amazon and I must say that I don't think I could have made it through without them. It was a night and day difference after switching to the Nike Free RN Distance. The blisters went away, the shin splints never returned, and my knees feel much better. I actually still feel like moving around after work. They're VERY comfortable, look even nicer in person, and I would highly recommend these shoes to someone that is highly active on their feet for long periods of time. As for the noise people are complaining about, it's true. They are quite clicky sounding when you first start wearing them, however, I have found mine to be pretty much silent after a good break in period. Great shoe overall. Hope this review helps. Amazing running shoes. These come recommended by roadrunners magazine so I ordered, tested, and I like feel. Superior running shoe. Fits like a well worn glove. Expensive but worth every dollar. Provides the benefits of every technological advance in padding,support , breath ability in a light as a feather shoe. I get complimented on the style of the shoe regularly, so there's that. EXCELLENT PRODUCT! MY SON IS ABSOLUTELY HAPPY, COMFORTABLE WEAR FOR THE WHOLE DAY! LIGHT AND GOOD LOOKING! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT! A very good looking shoe, but cut a little low around the ankle for my taste. Also, I get a sucking feeling and sound from the left shoe. Sorta like a suction cup. Fit as expected.

I already own 3 pairs of Nike free runs all size 7 but these are tighter than my others. I usually buy them so they are a little big so these fit tight but are fine with thin socks. I wish I would have ordered a 7.5 but all in all great shoe. Not returning because they are fine with thin socks and I cant wait to wear them to the gym LOVE these shoes. They fit the smallest bit tight but I like it because they stay in place while I run (which is usually an issue with slip on sneakers).

Kayano 21, 22, 23
Quantum 360
Quantum 360 CM
Nimbus 18
Kayano 24 fit me the best. The front toe box its very well. It's a at the Toe Box (Front of the shoe) and the heel has superb support. It hugs the heel slightly without being uncomfortable. The cushioning around the heel and ankle area is the BEST out of all the shoes I've owned listed above. Almost forgot to mention, the lite show on this model is the best yet. These shoes are back to how Kayanos used to fit. Nice work Asics. Great shoe, this is like the 6th kayano Ive owned. The fit is slightly different and the comments on the shoe being a little firmer are right, but nothing that made me think twice. This color is more of a white and gray which wasnt my first choice but it seemed like the shoe was selling fast. They are a little wider in the toe box, which I actually liked in comparison to the 22 and 23 series. I am coming from the GT2000 4 and when I was looking for an upgrade, all reviews said the new GT 2000's were not up to par with the previous versions. I have plantar fasciitis and every site I reviewed for the best running shoes for my condition and the Kayano's 24's were at the top of nearly every list so I gave them a go. They are a bit on the pricy side but they are worth every penny. Would definitely buy these again and again and again if the quality holds up. The shoe is very light and comfortable. Only issue that I have is that it doesnt offer enough support for over pronation. I tried running with them tight as I can get for comfort, but that wouldnt work for as I run my feet swell and the shoes felt even tighter. I am a big fan of the Asics Gel TR 150,170 and 180 leather cross trainers because they provide excellent support for my overpronation and I thought I would try the Kayano 24 in the hope that they would match the quality and support of the Gel TR series,they don't. That said, they do provide support if tied securely and used for running only, not cross training.The lateral support does not match that of the Gel TR series nor for that matter the Brooks Adrenaline GTS series of runners, which I prefer. Slightly wide near the ankle and feels like its almost going to come out when I am walking. Wish I could return this. Great show.

The shoes provide good arch support and I feel overall cushion is decent. If you decide to purchase, I would recommend going 1/2 size up. I really like the look of these shoes. They work as general workout trainers but also fit in with a pair of jeans. These are really comfortable and supportive. Sauconys fit my feet better than any other brand so this is going to be highly subjective. When my brother decided that he needed a new pair of shoe my husband and I worked on convincing to buy this brand. He found a pair he likes and is happy with his decision. He says ""I actually am really happy with the shoe. They are comfortable and my feet are no longer in pain."" He also mentioned that he liked the pop of color since his shoe's have to be black for work. I have tried many other shoes since then, but couldn't get the right fit, so I tried the newest version of a proven shoe (for me). I mostly walk in these, but I like that they are ""off road"" ready, which I sometimes do, plus I can run pavement in them without issue. Build quality seems good for now. I have had a few Saucony shoes in the last few years that didn't last as long as I had hoped so I will update this review if that is the case with these. The are great trail runners, especially at around $40. The traction is excellent for dirt, grass, sand, and gravel. The sole could be a bit beefier; when running though particularly rocky terrain I feel way more than I would like to, and the sole tends to flex a little more than I'm comfortable with. And they look good too. He wears them with a Spenco 3/4 arch support (also from amazon) My son likes these trail runners. He says the fit is good and the durability is ok so far- two weeks in. After years of great footwear we decided to give them another try. So far so good. As a Mom I like that the Saucony swish mark is reflective for all the evenings spent outside."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010TQ6T72/ref=asc_df_B010TQ6T721555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B010TQ6T72&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Ive own a couple of ASICS runners (Kayano, Cumulus, Sonoma) and the comfort level of this pair ranks alongside the rest of them. Felt like Ive worn them for ages. Kudos to Asics for coming up with such fine shoes. Did run in them on a Treadmill (still cold here), was not totally pleased, BUT, suspect the tread pattern and fit would support out door on hard pack surfaces -- will test in the spring.

I am a 9.5 in Nike and had to go up to a 11 in UA. Took me 2 returns to get to the right size which was a little annoying but happy now that I found the right size. Excellent shoe for people on their feet for long periods of time. I have had these shoes for about a year now and I have been enjoying them ever since. They can get pretty dirty but they wash up good and they are stylish. They are very comfortable and they look great. I actually bought two pair and I have not worn the second pair yet!!!!. Subscribe to my YouTube channel if you have any questions you'd like to ask me about it. I'll be doing a product review in the next few weeks just type in ""scrubJake"" or ""Jakie"" and I should be the first video :) thanks guys have a good one. I tried them on in a brick and mortar store first and then bought them on Amazon because I saved a few bucks. These shoes are lightweight and comfortable. I only use for the gym and so far they are great. This pair is less than $60 and I like it not just for the (pleasantly unexpected) lightweight, it actually looks good too. The same shoes Im diff color (red?) is at the high end range, probably still worth it if they last. I dont know how well they last since I just got them, assumed good so far and will update if it turns out otherwise. This pair felt great when I put them on and walked around the house. 20 minutes later I went for a run. made it about 1/4 mile before my arches started hurting. 1/4 mile later I was walking in the grass as there was no way I could run on a concrete surface and make it back home. These work well for him so I give them 5 stars. 0 stars for me due to the issue I faced but it is not on thoe, it is on me to find the right pair. i believe the shoes run small because i usually wear a shoe that is 1 to 1.5 times smaller than what i purchased. i had the chance to go to a shoe store to see what size i would wear in this particular manufacturer's shoe. So, when I say they ""fit as expected"", keep in mind that i knew what size i would need when i ordered them.

If you like a snug shoe or if you like wearing shoes without socks, these are really well made and they fit well. If you prefer a less snug fit or one that you can have more control with, I recommend the Puma Carson 2 Knit Sneaker. It is the same basic idea of using a knit upper for more ventilation but the using the tongue design on the shoe give you more flexibility and can be snug or more flexible as desired. My son, who is VERY PICKY WITH BRAND AND LOOK, loves these...he is 13 and into the expensive everything. I was happy to get a pair of shoes around $50 that made him happy and that are great quality. They are thick enough on the material than his regular picks of thin material shoes, that they look like they will hold up through the winter, and the sole is thick so this momma is happy to have a sturdy investment!. Nothing compares to the fit of a Knitted sneaker. It just hugs your feet, provides a snug fit without unecissary pressure points. I would recommend the Puma brand knitted sneakers to anyone. Theyre by far my favorite. Lightweight and great for running. Husband loves it. I tried on some pumas in a store and I'm glad I did. These fit tight width wise but good from toe to heel.

My 4th gen shoe in size 14 feels like a perfect fit (and no, it fits more like a 13). Narrow toe box, narrow midfoot and the heel is fine. Good treadwear. I'll probably have to switch brands after years of trusting Brooks to have the best combination of fit and comfort - they keep messing with their lines and they seem to be getting worse, not better, as the prices increase. Love the fit of these (have 2 pair)!. It has happened on both shoes and on the other pair as well. Will be reaching out to Brooks as well. I am a loyal Brooks Revenna customer, but these shoes have really let me down. Regardless of the limited workload, the right shoe has managed to tear near the top left hand side of the shoe (near the ankle). I went to a running specialty store and was recommended this shoe due to my ""overpronation"". Well, they recommended a size 10 which I purchased from a different retailer due to price. So I ordered a 10.5 on Amazon hoping the width was enough and as soon as I put them on I could feel how narrow they were again. If those are still too narrow I'm just going to ditch these shoes (and Brooks in general) and just find whatever feels good. Update: I purchased a Wide EE shoe and while the width was better, unfortunately it rubbed very hard on my big toe just walking around and would easily cause a blister after running for a bit. They are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. Been using them 5-6 days a week for lifting and 2-3 for running (about 2 miles per session) and they're holding up very well. I have followed my podiatrist's regime of stretches, had cortisone injections, and ordered special inserts - all with limited relief. I was a little hesitant at first because of the price but I am so glad I did. I could feel the arch support immediately and within a week the pain relief was in full force. Hopefully I am not being premature in my exuberant praise but as of now, 10 days after first putting them on, I am completely sold on them. They are extremely comfortable and provide a lot of support at the same time. Just perfect. I'll buy them again for sure once I'll wear out my old ones. I've been wearing Experia for a number of years and they've been great, I still love them, but I'm working on my first half marathon and have been getting squishy feet above 8 miles. Read a review and decided to try these, the padding is thinner but holds up well and though my feet sweat a lot when running, I haven't had near as much with these socks. I really like them through two runs so far."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01GEYZMM6/ref=asc_df_B01GEYZMM61555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01GEYZMM6&linkCode=asn&psc=1

555	15	New Balance Fresh Foam Lazr Sport	['Textile', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Sock-like collar construction', 'Laser engraving', 'Lightweight solid rubber outsole', '', '']	"My last two pair of shoes for work were Skechers memory foam, comfortable for about a a day and a half and the sole under the toe pan wore flat in under a month, and Nike Revolution 4, which felt like clown shoes from day one because of the giant pads on the sole that are completely inflexible and caused the toe pan to slap the ground/floor while walking and eventually caused foot pain/knee pain/hip pain. These New Balance, however, were comfortable out of the box and after four straight 8 hour+ days have only become more comfortable. After trying these I probably have left Nike completely aside from golf shoes because they are still easy to find in the right width. Should I have my hopes up. Still, I picked up the 10.5 ""wide"" which ended up being 10.5 2E. I usually buy 10.5 4E for slip-on/off ease, but 2E aren't usually a problem. These aren't horrible, but my feet are squished. I don't see the damage, so I assume it's somewhere inside the hem of that opening. In short, if you're looking for a roomie, comfortable shoe... order a half-size up. I bought these as a casual shoe that would hopefully be comfortable. They look good and are made to a decent standard, but after day one I noticed the toe box is a bit cramped. Excellent shoe. Fits great. I wear a 8.5 regular and got the 8.5 wide and it is very comfortable. Nice look. Feels like a pair of slippers. Nice shoe - our son noticed this a few weeks ago and the price, fit and quality is excellent. He loves the comfort, light fit feel and non marking soles. All day comfort with a silent glide to them. All in all, this new era of New Balance is great and these are no exception. These are worth MSRP but you can find them well under that, usually $35-$50 in most cases. Really, it's s pretty cool shoe. Feels light, comfortable. Best thing about this shoe and a rare thing in general nowadays, is there is an actual arch here.

From a single 5k run trying to brake them in gently I'm very pleased. I usually have a hard time getting use to new shoes so I found the first run very pleasing since I didn't feel anything stretched, tight or sore. They feel quite comfortable. The sole doesn't grip sandy route very well. The lacing is OK. I wear 12.5 in most shoes: Merrell, Inov-8, new balance, pearl izumi. I ordered 13 and it is still a little shorter and narrower than my 12.5 pearl izumi, but fits ok. I definitely need the D and not the 2E. They loosened up a little and I feel enough forefoot space for my toes. So my experience is go 1/2 a size up but width is true. Overall I'm still very pleased with this shoe, I like it much better than my pearl izumi h3 and last week I selected the saucony for all the workouts. sole shoes no wear and so is the upper. I was HIGHLY skeptical of these as i was used to 0mm drop shoes but these turned out to be absolute winners in terms of longevity of my run, and foot comfort. I feel that the forgiving nature of these shoes allow you to correct your form without being too unforgiving. I can easily go 8+ miles straight in these guys. Love them. This shoe is highly cushioned, but not mushy feeling when walking/running and anyone looking for an awesome stability shoe should seriously consider this one. That being said, this shoe runs SLIGHTLY small and narrow, but not terribly or unbearably tight. I am usually on the line between a wide and medium width shoe depending on the manufacturer, but I could get my feet into a medium sized 9 without any discomfort, and that's saying something for me since I'm typically on the line between wide and medium width. I, again, could easily fit my foot into the shoe, and I still had enough room in the toe box and maybe a quarter-inch worth of room between my big toe and the upper, but that being said, I think moving up to a size 9.5 will accommodate for my slightly wide-ish foot and give my big toe the wiggle room I like at the end of my shoes (usually a thumbnail's width).So in summary, is it a little bit narrow and short? yes. Enough to warrant giving an awesome shoe a poor review. Maybe instead of knocking an awesome shoe for being slightly short, just go try it on first before buying it. Hope this helped any prospective shoppers. Read more Love these shoes. They are so comfortable. I feel like wearing these shoes all day.

(I have relied on ASIC Gel Kayano as my regular running shoes. Before that it used to be New Balance 12xx series -- but that preference changed, sadly, when the shoe was redesigned and not made in USA any more.)

I am thrilled Hurricane Iso 2 is giving a nice competition to my trusted ASIC Gel Kayano -- which BTW is great, nothing wrong with those. But these Saucony shoes have even more cushion, and hold my foot snug and comfortable. My guess is the shoe will expand slightly as I break it in. Really enjoying these shoes, however, as a long-time wearer of New Balance I did feel like the toebox was a little more narrow than I expected. I took Amazon's recommendation to order a half-size larger than what I would normally wear and after a month or so of daily use the shoes did stretch a bit and fit really really well now. These badboys have changed the amount i can run without intense pain. The ""newest"" iteration for me, iso 2, feel great like the previous models. The one change, which isn't bad, is that they feel less ""plush"" on the soles and more responsive. So far, so great. I walk stairs five days a week and I am a large man so I need solid shoes with rugged cushioning; these Saucony's fill the bill. I have many pairs of this brand in various models, but the Hurricanes are my favorite because of the beefed up cushioning. They aren't the lightest model because of that, but I am more than good with it. They fit just right. Brooks shoes tend to fit slightly small, but Saucony makes theirs right on the money for me. They are good looking shoes that breathe well and support me while I pound the stairs. A good investment at a good price through Amazon.

I will be sending these back and wait to see if they go back to the addiction 12, or even better 11, design. color and shoe look nice, toe box is too narrow in the size 13ee. Too bad, they used to make a really nice comfortable shoe for people with wider feet and a few foot problems. Did you save 4 cents a shoe. I wish that my fingers were strong enough t o hold onto the little piece of real estate in order to get these on. Look, I've both over a dozen pairs of Brooks the last several years that were great but these are an atrocity. All because you guys lost a hint of a clue on how to design a comfortable running shoe. One can only hope. Thinking about sending them abck, but Lately Amazon has ben canceling accounts that send too many ""defective"" items back. I may chance it however. I have been an ASICS GT fan for several years. However my challenge when purchasing new shoes is finding a great quality shoe in my size which is a 14 Narrow. The stability is far better than the ASICS GT series that I have been wearing. In addition they look great. You can not go wrong! good solid shoe with plenty of toe room and great arch support. just had knee replacement and these shoes completely filled my expectations for my rehab therapy These were purchased with anticipation they'd be like the preceding model year. Upon return, Asics were ordered and those fit fine. Miss wearing the Brooks, as they're a great shoe normally, but the ""13"" was unlucky for me. I normally order shoes in 10D (medium width) but with these shoes had to go to size 11D. Even then they are a bit short and narrow feeling. Shoe quality appears to be very good, just seems to be some sizing issues. My wife recently bought a new pair of shoes and they ran small as well. While the shoe is very comfortable to walk in, the shoe adhesives are breaking down on the inside of shoe.

We recommend ordering 1/2 size larger than your normal shoe size. Of course, if this isn't correct, you can exchange it for the right size.""]"	"The Xero shoes fill in all my other shoe/sandal needs, but I can certainly run in them. My posture, balance, core strength and running technique are all drastically improved. I am now basically a zealous opponent of conventional padded shoes with raised heels and the biomechanical deficiencies they facilitate. I love that they now make the Hana and Prio in all black and it's what compelled me to finally buy the Prio. The patent-pending design of the sole is simple and great. The front of the toe box on the full shoes and general design is very nice, and the strap system allows the shoe to move and stay with your foot. The Hanas are more comfortable than any slippers I have worn but even with the slip-on sort of style, I can run with them because of the straps. As far as sizing I'd recommend erring on the larger size. It wasn't until I found closed toe, zero-drop/padding shoes that I could really convert so I'm glad it's becoming more widely available and Xero seems to be really leading the way on how to build them nicely. Read more I tried the shoe on and it fit fine, after my first run though I got a blister on the top of my pinky toe due to the seam when material comes together (top part of my foot). I could try using a 1/2 size larger, but of course since I cant exchange I would be buying a second pair and hope that solves the issue.
3. The article spoke of blisters on the bottom of the feet (zero shoes, makes sense however my blisters were on the top and had to do with the shoe and not running with minimal cushion). I'm impressed. Every other zero drop shoe I've tried- like the Altra 2.0, Topo ST2, and Merrill Glove- all had issues as far as I'm concerned. The Altra and Topo only works if you just happen to have the exact foot their shoe inserts want you to have- which I definitely don't. The Xero shoe is great because it has both a little bit of padding appropriate for any surface and the shoes are simply flat- so you can either gradually adjust to that or get the appropriate inserts. And zero drop also means the Achilles don't get shorted, quads don't get overworked, lower back doesn't get exhausted, and the anterior lower leg muscles aren't always tired from countering the forward tilt that a heel would force. To try to clear up some questions about sizing, here's a comparison of fit with other barefoot/minimalist brands. I have extremely wide feet and felt that the width was pretty good, could be a touch wider in the toes. With the insoles out and thin socks the Xeros' are a good fit. All the other brands/sizes listed above fit well with insoles in and can be worn with thick socks. They seem well made and comfortable if you like the minimalist shoe thing and I like the look better than the Primal 2's, that's subjective of course"	https://www.amazon.com/Xero-Shoes-Prio-Minimalist-Barefoot/dp/B07NZZKZTP?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07BZCDP7M&psc=1

This is a significant upgrade over the Ride 8. The 9's outsole is much more responsive and feels like it could be suited for your uptempo runs too. Fit is just right but for me, they work best with a thinner pair of socks versus a thicker more cushiony pair. You can adjust the lacing easily to get just the right fit and they don't feel like a heavier, workhorse pair of shoes. Great job Saucony. Clearly this company cheapened up their shoes from those sold a few years ago, and the sizing is off too. I was a big Saucony fan until this blunder. I even recommended them to others. The other reports found here of narrow clearances are true. Now, I am buying shoes 1-1/2 to 2 sizes larger than I wore all my life and they seem fine. Even at a different shoe store they told me they recommend buying at least 1/2 size large, and another half size if you are using special athletic inserts. When I decided to so myself a favor and go back to the Ride model I got the same size as the Ride 8s I had worn. This was a bit surprising to start but quickly fit my stride. The last provided a fantastic area for my foot to land and splay and the upper held tight to prevent any slippage (I run in size 9 for room but wear 8.5 comfortably in most shoes). The iBR+ tread is significantly worn after a couple dozen mi of paved trail funning (concrete and asphalt). Overall - A great shoe that (if it lasts) should serve me for 500+ mi. I had a special offer from Holabird Sports ($60 off one day special). I really like the cushioning of the shoes. Feels good on the street as well as treadmill. And so far the Ride 9 has been great. So I went with an 11.5 and it feels good, I'm glad I went up, just not a full size up. I'll be interested to learn about the Ride 10 that just came out (maybe that's why Holabird had a big one-day sale!). Although the cushioning is SUPERB (like running on clouds) the upper produced friction with the top of my left foot and it was really uncomfortable after the 10K mark so the plan to use this shoes during Chicago 2016 were postponed. In the end I used my Saucony Triumph ISO shoes, which was a mistake but that's another story. It is only now, after about 100 miles on the Ride 9's that I have been able to find comfort in them. Now they feel great upper-wise. The shoe feels a little narrow but the cushioning, responsiveness and weight of this shoe make it a good deal for them	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018EZAZLG/ref=asc_df_B018EZAZLG1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B018EZAZLG&linkCode=asn&psc=1

After some poking around online to see if I could get a better deal, we tried the Ride 7 - and older version of the shoe he had liked in the store. At half the price, it was worth at least trying. He loves them. They have good support and keep his feet much more comfortable when running. He has a tendency to trip and roll his ankles, but these shoes keep his foot much more stable. They breathe well, and are not too heavy. He is very happy with them. Simply the best running shoe ever made. I've ran in pretty much all of Brooks, Asics, Hooka, Altra, and the like and I keep returning to these. The seven is way better than the eight in my opinion. I log a lot of miles and Im a big man (65 250lb) so I put a beating on theses and they hold up and provide great comfort and support. They are the best balance of lightness and cushion. Super plush upper, feels like a slipper. HOWEVER, this was after retiring them for casual weekend wear, out and about. They lasted in this capacity until my pinky toe popped through a hole, a good 8-9 months after they were done running. All in all, a very comfortable workhorse of a running shoe. I love the 8 as well. These are probably the best athletic shoes I have ever owned. I was surprised that I usually wore a size 9 and when I had these fit, they sold me a 10.5 They were comfortable right out of the box and are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had. I was pleasantly surprised when I found them on Amazon for less than $70.00 when I had paid $120.00 for my first pair, so I ordered these and I love them. All excellent. The Ride 7 I ordered fits perfect. For me the Ride series is the best because it is light, give me neutral support and last almost a year. The Ride 7 I have been asked about was perfect out of the box. I have a metal plate in one ankle and these shoes are wonderful for running and walking. Don't cause any pain. Excellent support. Many years ago, following knee surgery, my doctor recommended Saucony shoes for my rehab. I wore them and loved them, so when I wanted a new pair this time, I bought these, not knowing much about their cushioning. These were, and still are comfortable to wear, and although I have newer shoes, I still wear these from time to time. The next pair of shoes that I purchase might well be Saucony, but with more forefoot padding. Overall, these have been great shoes. I love these shoes. I felt like I was running on air. This time Im sticking with Saucony and will never buy crappy cheap shoes ever again. I actually wear a men's sneaker for a little wider fit and comfort.

Above the sole, the sock feel is real. 4th day wearing them and a thread was sticking out of the shoe, I'm a man of quality, and honesty. This shoe has great quality with the sole and the seams. The shoes are holding together very well. Still very comfortable. The only downfall to this shoe is the ability to hold your foot solid on the bottom of your shoe.

Been two months almost since I had them, pretty soldi shoes. I was really excited about this shoe as Ive been putting many miles on my Vapor Glove 3s. I was expecting a similar fit but these werent even close. It seems as though the additional structure and thickness of the outsole also conforms the upper to a narrower fit. Great improvement over gen 1. I love the half attached tonge - makes it faster to put on. As with all shoes of this kind the arch support is minimal. I have a thick and wide foot and these shoes fit great all aroind. Good traction on wet and dry trails. It's definitely too big & now I'll have to return them & order another pair. Merrill's are the Best. Wish I didn't have to spend more money to return plus buy another pair. Yesssss - love these shoes. These have a little more support and tread than the glove runners I love, making them even more comfortable and versatile. The color is fantastic, too. Theses are great for trail running; they have really good grip and if you are gonna be running in a rocky area these are great barefoot shoes to wear.

Without question I ordered another XA Pro 3D GTX. I have probably owned 4-5 pairs of those now, as well as several other models of road/cross running shoes. However I took a chance and bought this pair of shoes, and boy am I glad I did. I run a few times per week outside as well. I realize that I wear these shoes less, but considering that even, these shoes have still held up much better. They are comfortable to wear, have good cushion and support, and are lightweight. I am really pleased with them and am glad to see that Salomon is making quality products even though there have been a few bumps. I would recommend these shoes especially. Read more Wow, these shoes are so comfortable. I wore Merrells for years and had great luck but my most recent pairs fell apart within months. I heard about Salomons from a few of my hiking friends and got a pair of boots and loved them so much I wanted a sneaker for daily use. I know these say they are for running but they are great for everything. I love the neoprene tongue as it hugs your foot but is not tight, it prevents your foot from sliding in the shoe without constricting it. They are also very lightweight and breathable. literally have not worn any of my other shoes since I got these a month ago. So far I am very impressed with this brand, if these hold up like my Salomon boots they will last a long time. Perfect shoe for the cities. The toe is a little narrow but not too bad, the tongue is neoprene and it attaches right in the arch of your foot which takes some getting used to. The color that I got on sale was obnoxious but it will be fine after I get used to it. They're pretty comfortable but honestly I expected more from Solomon. They seem well made. This is the best fitting running shoes I've ever bought by far. I purchased a size 9 and it is absolutely comfortable. I do a lot of running and I would recommend this shoes for anyone. Excellent shoes. I love it. The shoe looks great. A little tight to put on but once you slide it on they are a perfect fit. They are cool and comfortable. Near perfect for me. I love this shoe. The sole is well cushioned and solidly built. I highly recommend. My husband loves them

Definitely get half a size larger. I got these because they are supposedly the lightest running shoes around and should feel like running barefoot but I just dont feel the lightness. The shoe looks great but it runs way too small. I typically where a size 8 or 8.5 in casual shoes, a Euro 39, but I prefer my running shoes a bit larger. I have a pair of Altra Olympus in a size 9 (Euro 40.5) and could easily have been comfortable in a half size bigger. I made a mistake and ordered these shoes in the Unisex 7, because I am typically comfortable running in that size of men's shoe. They fit more like an 8. They are also somewhat narrow over the top of the foot near the ball. I've seen this mentioned in other reviews and thought it was a weird thing, but when I got the shoes, they definitely felt tight there. (I have also seen Altra's response to posts about the tight fight, in which they indicate that this shoe is intended to fit provide a lower profile fit than their other shoes. It's almost nothing once the insert is removed and would be a dreamy minimalist racing shoe if it were easier to get the sizing right. The sole of the shoe shows significant tread wear after just one short run. I went with the 8.5 in these for length as the 8s felt like my toes would rip through the upper. I am not hard on my shoes at all. The best thing going for these shoes is their weight. Incredibly light and very flexible. Sadly, these shoes just arent worth the money for the speed of wear and the difficulty in getting a good fit. It's pretty simple: the shoe is super light and the reflex plate gives it a bit of rigidity that I like for road racing. Yes the shoes run small so add a shoe size so you're not disappointed with fit. It's not necessarily made to last yet I'm just using it for shorter (5K, 10K) races when I want speed. The Topo brand also does a great job with the foot shape. These shoes allow your toes to splay which is important for folks like me who run with proper stride. I use the larger ones with the optional insoles which offer a bit more support and cushioning for training and longer runs - and they are absolutely perfect! plenty of room for toes to spread out, very comfortable and no pains or pangs whatsoever. The lightness has also improved my running cadence. I use the smaller pair for speedwork without the optional insole and this allows for better ground feel, even less weight and an all round perfect shoe. Each shoe set comes with the optional insoles which do change the shoe characteristics by adding a bit more cushioning and support but due to the sizing - it's unlikely that you'll be able to use the same shoe comfortably with and without the insole. For anyone who subscribes to the zero drop technical running school Altra have really designed an amazing shoe here. Super light. The ground feel is good. The responsiveness is good also may be due to the propel plate. After a few break in, I feel ok. The upper is flexible enough to let toes moving freely. One minor drawback is that the tongue is too thin, therefore the shoe lace make my top foot not so comfy somettimes	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-AFU1812F-Mens-Vanish-R-Sneaker/dp/B071ZQX4DS?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073P8G9DQ&psc=1

582	12	Altra One 2.5	['100% Quick-Dry Mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Ombre-colored running shoe featuring asymmetric toe overlay and lace-up closure', 'ZeroDrop platform with 0mm heel-to-toe offset', 'Dual-layer EVA midsole with A-Bound top layer', 'InnerFlex midsole flex grooves', 'Foot-Shaped Toe Box accommodates toe splay']	"It encouraged natural form, toe splay, strengthening of the foot. I also found it to be great on non-technical trails and oddly for snowshoeing. I went up a ""half size"" in the One2 (size 10 instead of 9.5) because I found that the lower toe cap contacted the top of my great toe. Otherwise fit was great. The exposed EVA sole remains light and amazingly flexible. The toe-box is a bit taller, accommodating the great toe better. ***The One 2.5 is true-to-size for me now.*** The durometer of the mostly-exposed midsole has changed a bit: it is firmer, a bit harder. I debate whether I like the 2.0 or 2.5 ride more. The truth is, they are different but both useful. The 2.0 is a bit more comfortable, the 2.5 is a bit more responsive. Treadwear on either model is amazing. Yes, the exposed EVA wears away visibly but this does not affect the ride or the traction, except in wet conditions. An added bonus: my 8-year-old son wears the One Junior. My final impression hasn't changed over the last 2 years. I really, really enjoy these shoes. While most of the credit goes to my marathon training over the summer, I credit these for part of the improvement. I figure I did about 1,500 or so steps per mile (8 min/mile pace, 180 cadence) and, over the course of a half marathon, that equates to about 20,000 steps where you're saving about 2 ounces (over my beloved Newton Distance S3 trainers) each step, or 40,000 ounces of lifting. I say that partly in jest, as a stride is more than just picking your leg off the ground, but there's got to be SOME truth to this decreased effort being a beneficial thing to one's performance. Durability-wise, I only have about 30 miles on these and there are no signs of wear, but I agree with another poster here - these are probably best used as race shoes. So, bottom line, I love 'em. The combination of great cushioning (Hoka-like) in an incredibly light shoe (again, 6.8 ounces!) is just amazing, even over 26.2 miles. Never thought I'd see the day where there'd be a shoe suited for racing 5Ks all the way to full marathons, but this is it.

*** UPDATE 11/9/2015 *** I ran the 2015 Across the Bay 10K yesterday and, yet again, these were wonderful. Sure, my marathon training over the summer largely gets the credit, but these proved once again that they're great race-day shoes. I now have 61.3 miles on them and they're holding up well so far"	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-One-Running-Shoe/dp/B01B7AZ81M?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00TXEFAC2&psc=1
583	13	Saucony Breakthru 3	['100% Textile and Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Racing-inspired everyday running shoe with perforated upper in ombre-fade design', 'Everun insole with 8 mm drop provides responsive cushioning']	"These are the best shoes I have run in for quite some time. These shoes feel light and comfortable, without too much padding, and the Everun has great return throughout the run. My stride is neutral, and these don't interrupt my normal motion. The stitchless upper is a material that I haven't run in before, but the build quality is good, and I haven't noticed any issues where the upper bonds to the sole or transitions to the laces. I bought a pair of Asics FuzeX Rush shoes at the same time, because I wanted to see which energy return technology was better, and the Saucony is far superior, in my opinion. I was able to grab a pair of these on Amazon for $54, and at that price, these are a fantastic shoe. They're suitable for a faster pace and shorter distances where weight may be a factor as they come in pretty light. I also like that the lacing is very easy to work with and can be put on and taken off relatively quickly. Example if you wear an 11 in nike. 10.5 is perfect. Light and comfortable road shoes Kind of narrow, but still excellent I have used Saucony running shoes before and I REALLY like them. They are light weight, fits right and look good. I like them to have a little more cushion. These are close to being the perfect casual shoe/sneaker for me.....I can rack up a lot of steps on my fitbit with these babies on my feet.....and ""mall walk"" with the teenagers! lol Great running shoes, comfortable, and soft.

The Dyad 8 was almost as good. It is a hard, narrow, shoe with little arch support and NONE of the cushiness the previous Dyads had. I have been wearing dyads for years and years and have always loved them. They always lasted one year or better. Seems they feel theyve made their name now and they want that to carry them instead of quality. My doctor recommended the Dyad for me when the 8 was the latest. I got 2 pair of the 8 and still find it to be the best shoe ever made for my purposes. I've since picked up 2 pair of the 9 (product being reviewed here) and while I still feel a bit more partial to the 8, there is nothing NOT to like about the 9. This is a super high-quality shoe. Brooks makes great shoes that meet all the needs for arch support, comfort, durability, etc. Plus it is a good looking shoe. Once the material around the heel becomes softer and more malleable, then the shoes fit well. This is my third pair of Dyads and this is my favorite version so far. The color of shoes are a great dark gray and the blue is amazing see blue that can almost seem purple. The shoes are true to size and are comparable to the sizes of New Balance. It is perfect for people with a low arch. The shoe is well constructed and the sole wears well walking/running on concrete sidewalks. This particular color combination goes well with any color of attire. This walking shoe is quite possibly the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn. It fits my foot perfectly and provides a level of comfort for my feet, which are prone to pain at times. I recently wore them on a 10 day trip to New York City and Canada which involved a good amount of walking. These shoes performed beautifully, even through some good rain and puddles. Highly recommended.	https://www.amazon.com/Brooks-Mens-Dyad-9/dp/B01GEXFBD2?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01M61GRH2&psc=1

My true size is 9 and Amazon suggested 9 (now shows 9.5???) when I ordered and they fit better than I expected. Very comfortable too. Yeah, I'll burn that bridge if I ever get there (never). Price was also fantastic ($68) vs $130+ for new Peregrine 8 (11 oz) just released. These are great, they breathe well and dry quickly if you accidentally drop them crossing a stream. Not my proudest moment but if it had been my boots my hike would have been much less enjoyable. The tread is amazing, great traction even on steep gravel grades, you can feel the trail too which I think is nice. I'm a 9.5 Mens shoe but these size 10's fit perfect. I used this shoe for a 13.5 mile Spartan Beast run (Vernon NJ) with zero break-in and it performed awesome, no blisters. This sneaker has great traction in mud / slippery rock and going up and down slopes. The tread pattern works awesome, like knobby dirt bike tires for your feet. Good cushioning. Great stability for a shoe with so much padding. I like a shoe with a minimal or zero drop but I also like cushioning and with only 4 mm this sneaker works very well. Bought these for maybe a more peculiar reason than trail running, but it's all the same. Used for about 300 miles of bike touring across Arizona (included lots of hiking the bike up steep hills), as well as backpacking the Grand Canyon rim to rim. The shoes held up great, fit snugly (not small, just snug as they should), and the aggressive tread provided great grip. Would definitely recommend. After only 3 months of easy use the mesh tore through by the toes. Bummer, because the shoes are REALLY comfortable. My replacement shoe is the Altra 3.5, which I'm loving so far. YMMV :-) These shoes are really comfortable and have lots of grip on the soles. These would make better hiking shoes than running shoes. So far so good. Really great traction- and the same for foot protection. I feel like I made a good choice for the shoe and size. I would have added that 5th star but after one run I can't go crazy. They are nice shoes.	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Peregrine-Trail-Running/dp/B01MQYOHVA?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01HXGRX3U&psc=1

That advice was spot on and glad I did. Second: That tread is pretty sweet. I usually have a small amount of road on the way as well. The grip has so far been substantial and reassuring despite the low height of the lugs. I was concerned I would have to go with the much more aggressively lugged ST version, but I need not have worried. Third: Fit. It has a nice wide toebox and the laces can get snug without becoming uncomfortable. The tongue is well padded and stays put. I can usually get through a whole run with a single knot and not retie, so the laces are well made. My heel stays planted and engaged. The shoe has a subtle tendency to roll on my foot on these sections and, while staying planted on the trail, is somewhat less than confidence inspiring. Its awesome and it works. I have had a couple pair of Adidas Ultraboost and currently road run in the Saucony Freedom ISO. I am a believer in TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane). This material was registered by BASF, and is both Boost and Everun. It is much more durable than standard shoe midsole material while returning much more energy to your stride. While not as overt as in the Ultraboost shoe, the material still demonstrates excellent rebound after your foot strike and Ill wager youll notice. Love TPU. Thanks, chemistry. Summary: I like these shoes. Dont have much to say about durability yet as this is basically a first take, but so far I like. My heretofore favorite has been the Nike Wildhorse/Terra Kiger, but these Koas will test my allegiance. Hope this helps. Read more I am a solid size 10.5 in just about all shoes.

This I do like better than the earlier model of the shoe. It is extremely breathable, like to the point that I can feel the breeze on my toes. Read more I am not a big fan of Salomon's, but these are good straight forward running shoe. I like how they grip and conform to my feet and are very light and easy to place.

I used to constantly deal with ingrown toe nails from shoes that fit tight around the toes. The zero drop design also helps me not to have pain in my heel from planter fasciitis. Read more Altra's design solved all of my leg issues. These are great shoes, especially if you are running distance. I've had a couple of pairs of oxfords for a long time with a ""natural"" toe box shape that are very comfortable. Now that I've found Altra, I will never go back to a narrower ""normal"" toe box in a casual or athletic shoe. The reflective holographic cast of the Impulse Flash upper looks very cool. I used the Altra website shoe finder/size wizard to help find the right size. These Altra Impulse Flash street/running/crosstraining shoes and the Altra Lone Peak 3.0 trail runner/hiking shoes fit a little more snugly than similar New Balance athletic shoes with a slightly high instep, but sizing is the same for me. So far the arch support for me is OK.

The choice of material seems top notch. Another change from previous models is the upper which is a thinner gel like flexible material which is very nice. I was unsure about the tread with it's diamond shape traction and Merrell's own rubber since this model doesn't incorporate a Vibram sole. To my surprise the traction is amazing and theses things can make you climb like a goat. Decent are managed well too. The shoe really does stick to where you plant it and sharp turns are done with ease. I really don't feel it too much with running since I don't heal strike. Wish they had kept the arch low like a true minimal zero drop. Read more I was a real fan of the bare access 4. It was an incredibly versatile shoe, light, super responsive, firm, protective, affordable, and good looking, too. Are these successors. Yes, and no, as they seem to be a combination between the bare access 4, and the bare access ultra (also discontinued). Though, shape and fitwise (true to size), they appear almost identical to ba4's, the midsole appears to be more like the ba-ultra's, which feel slightly more numb and crushable than the highly responsive midsoles of the ba4's. Consequently, for running, the ride feels less agile, and it leaves the arch of the foot feeling a tad numb, achy, and over-worked, banged up through the midfoot support, which seems paradoxical as the ba-ultra's appeared to be a softer version of the ba4's. The bare access flex perhaps is a more comfortable shoe for general wear (i.e. standing and walking around the office), but not so for road-running especially if one is hot off the heels of the ba4's. I can't speak for trail use, because I tested them exclusively on the road, so as to keep them cleaner in case i needed to return them (which was a good call). How these shoes are improved over the ba4's is that, despite lacking the vibram outsoles, they appear to be more durable, as unlike the ba4's, they showed zero wear after my first 5 mile test run (besides having a few crush lines in the midsole not exhibited in the ba4's), which I accredit to the laterally split lugs, which allow them to bend rather than absorb the full impact. Also, besides being slightly more comfortable to stand and smoother to walk in, they also are a bit better looking than the ba4's. So, in conclusion, if you're looking for a good-looking, zero drop shoe for general shoe, these are still a great option. If you're looking for replacement for the ba4's, I'd say go for the Trail Glove 4's, which happen to inherit the super-responsiveness of the ba4's, yet also happen to be even more durable even for road running, despite being marketed for the trail and having more prominent lugs. They also look very cool, too. Fit perfect, comfortable to wear. Well designed and made. Love all my Merrell shoes and boots. These sneakers are light on the feet yet have a nice thick rubber sole. Great for walking, biking or running

This is the softest, bounciest Wave Creation to date', '', '']	The Mizuno Men's Wave Creation 20 Running Shoe is not a cheap, or inexpensive, running shoe. It _is_ a nice, well-made, high quality running shoe. There are definitely some things you will want to know before deciding to buy these shoes. Some of them are very good and some of them might keep you from buying them - it all depends on what you consider important in a running shoe. They are nice looking, but they are not flashy in a way that other's would notice or know that you paid a lot for these shoes. What they are, is very high quality running shoes with a novel way of adding support to your arches, and decreasing the impact on your shins. There is a big open space in the heel and arch areas that creates an arch or bridge-like structure that act like a large spring. I like them a lot. The soles also create an odd feeling of almost twisting your foot as you push off, I think this is because they actually create a very straight push off from the ground, but I am used to twisting a little and these shoes resist that twist. It is an unusual feeling, but I think it could possibly improve my stride by helping me eliminate that twist that I didn't even know I was doing. I honestly think you have to try them and see for yourself what I am talking about, and if they are returnable then I highly recommend you try these because it definitely exposes any error in your stride and it very likely could train you to push off more directly and to avoid twisting. I truly believe these could correct a bad stride and make you a better runner. Or it could just be hype and maybe I am over thinking it, but I _REALLY_ liked them. Other than the gentle correction of any twisting that you have in your stride, the shoe is comfortable to wear and is lightweight and very form-fitting, like a second skin. I would absolutely recommend these to a serious runner, and to anyone using shoes as a sport like basketball or tennis. These are five stars, expensive but worth it in my opinion. I hope you find this to be a helpful review. If there is anything more you would like to know, please ask. If you ask something and I don't get back quickly, please check my profile page and email me and I will try to respond as soon as I see it. I think it is important for fellow shoppers on Amazon to look out for one another by letting each other know if a product is good, or if it is a stinker. I take reviewing very seriously and try to be helpful. Thank you. Read more I wanted to try the Wave Rider (top-rated on Wirecutter), but this was available, and it's great. These were completely comfortable on the paved trail I walk on. They look very technical, with a weird exposed heel apparatus, but they are definitely great for gym or street walking. They are a great looking shoe, understated, with just a touch of red, they even have red aglets on the laces. The sneakers fit a little small compared to a Nike or Adidas size 10 1/2, but I have found that is typical of Mizuno. The soles of the shoes are springy with air in them, the ankle support is firm yet comfortable and the tongue of the shoe has excellent padding.

609	9	Saucony Guide 8	['100% Textile and synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Lightweight runner with patterned mesh and no-sew overlays', 'Weight: 9.9 oz.', '8mm heel-to-toe offset', 'PowerGrid full-length cushioning', '', '', '', '']	Saucony has always been one of my favorite brands of shoe for running and other sports in general. This particular shoe, the Saucony Men's Guide 8, didn't disappoint. It is an attractively designed stable running shoe that is both lightweight and supportive. The shoe does tend to fit a bit narrow or small for me and in this regard I was tempted to give the shoe 4 stars but decided against it. Nevertheless, if you are a consumer accustomed to using other brands of running shoe, you may want to purchase this particular shoe a 1/2 size larger. Over time the shoe stretched enough to allow me to use my orthotic insoles for my plantar fasciitis. The Saucony Guide 8 is an excellent choice for long distance running/training and is perhaps the best choice in the Saucony line for runners with mild pronation. I am satisfied, and would certainly purchase the Saucony brand again. Read more I bought these well over a year ago, and I estimate I have at least 1,200 miles on them. But these have lasted longer than any pair of shoes I've ever owned, while still providing excellent support. Considering I got them for $43 compared to the $80-120 I usually spend on running shoes, these are the best value I've ever gotten for a pair of shoes. An excellent product, and I will definitely be buying from Saucony again. The length of the men's 8.5 is perfect for a woman's size 10 foot. The width fit my foot just fine--not any wider than my women's MEDIUM width shoe. On my feet, these shoes look like a woman's fit. Loosening the laces does not fix the problem. I have worn Saucony shoes for close to twenty years, and with the exception of this pair and one other pair, have always had excellent luck. Instead of paying the high price at the store, I checked Amazon and found the same pair. Considering how much they are in a store and how much he uses them, it's still a good price. It is like my feet's best friend. They make running more fun and less pain. First impressions, these shoes got it. They look great and you can tell they are made out of great quality materials. The front of the shows have a fabric that allows great ventilation (you can feel the breeze going inside your feet). The inside is very well padded and does not bother my wide feet. The back of the heel does not rub at all like other brands, preventing any blisters from forming. The shoe strings are long enough to change the tightness and their quality is one of the best. This pair is very well priced compared to retail stores. So, I would say that if you want great shoes soon. Amazon is the place to save. I use these shoes primarily to run, but as a default they are super comfortable for walking. It is like stepping on pillows made out of clouds. These shoes have mastered the art of taking care of your feet for runs and walks. On the other hand, these shoes will not assist you in cross-training or weight lifting activities when grip and balance are crucial. After some physical therapy and some strengthening of supporting muscles, the therapist evaluated my feet's angle during my runs. Saucony Guide 8 is the best remedy for a mild over-pronation. I wear these for practice and find them to be very supportive. They are very comfortable. My feet do not hurt after practice. I would recommend them for anyone who runs or anyone who wants supportive sneakers	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Guide-Running-Shoe/dp/B0002M14RE?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00KPU1AHM&psc=1
610	10	Mizuno Wave Enigma 5	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately 2.5"" from arch', 'Paralell Wave sadwiched between U4icX midsole', 'EVA strobel board last for underfoot comfort', 'Luxurious airmesh upper provides a glove like fit', '8.8 oz 12 mm ramp']"	"Now that we've gotten that out of the way, on to the comprehensive part of the review:

First impressions: This a really great looking shoe. Possibly the best looking shoe I've ever seen from Mizuno. Really nice to see that the company has been greatly upping its design game in recent years. This shoe features really nice detail and trim elements. I especially like the logo on the back (embossed in a small circle of material), and the subtle reflective material that sits behind some mesh toward the front. Second impression: This is an extremely well built shoe. Everything feels super well integrated, layer upon layer. But the flip side of a well built shoe is that there is a lot of shoe here. These things are definitely a bit on the heavy side. Once on my feet, I found the fit to be fairly nice. The mid foot is perhaps a tiny bit narrow, but I think that might help avoid slippage and hot spots, so for the moment I'm calling it a feature. On the road these responded pretty much as expected. If you like the stiffness provided by the wave plate, coupled with heavy cushioning and a bit of bounce, you're going to enjoy these. Like other Mizunos, they're a bit stiff in the forefoot at first, but will loosen up with time. Given the weight, heel drop, wave plate stiffness, and cushion factor, it's no surprise that these deliver a ride that is at once both extremely comfortable and a bit clunky. All in all, I'm very happy with these and look forward to putting several hundred somewhat slower miles on them. And if nothing else, that's what I wanted to really stress in this review: These are great shoes, as long as you're using them for the right kinds of runs. I am always on the hunt for a perfect long distance trainer. The Wave Enigma is a great long distance trainer for me and here is way:

1) Very comfortable and still firm enough to take a beating. I have put a number of miles on them and the shoes still look like new. I am expecting 250-300 miles on them, which is good for me. Many shoes have mid sole collapse or dramatic tread-wear for me at 200 miles (read Nike here).
4) Good colors that don't scare the neighbors. The blue here is a decent color that goes well with jeans, for when they reach retirement.
5) Enough stability built in to protect a neutral runner. This is enough to keep an average Joe like me in line for the long haul. A little extra protection is more important to me.These are solid trainers and should appeal to a broad range of neutral runners. Fit is glove like. Read more This is, in my opinion, the best running shoe that Mizuno makes. Although I wouldn't recommend as a cross trainer, they actually have a pretty wide base, and offer more lateral stability than many other distance shoes. Again, not recommended, but these do really good with straight light sprint training if you are into HIIT walk/jog/sprint type workouts. These are far better running shoes. After their completing their useful service life as my running shoes, these now see duty as around town, casual shoes and are very comfortable. I actually ran a half ironman in them back in May and ordered another pair bc I liked them so much. Long story short I tend to me more of a heel striker when I run and these Mizuno Enigma 5's were recommended to me by a local shoe store. Very comfortable and a noticeable difference from my other mizunos"	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Mens-Wave-Enigma-Running/dp/B0109SJRN8?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00SMRXDTI&psc=1

The full rock plate handles the rocky terrain very well, and traction is great on textured rock. Things are still pretty slick on the flat mossy rocks of the PNW, and also wet logs, but I don't know of any shoe that can address that completely.

Used them asap once I got them. They were a bit snug, I will accredit this to my feet being a bit swollen from my weight (I do not have the betus fyi, just a big dude), but after 10 to 15 min and you start walking around on them, you don't feel it anymore. At the end of the day I am no longer limping, and it legit feels like your riding on air. They tend to loosen a bit as you work/walk around in them, mainly due to the constant moving of my feet, kneeling, dropping down to my knees to stock product, but over all great. The BOA button does pop up rather easily at times, and one side came off completely when I got caught on a Uboat (metal cart with high handles to carry product,) but it easily popped back in (sigh of relief haha.) Overall I give this product an amazing review due to the fact that it feels amazing when I walk. I really think they under valued their product, but, it is perfect, because not all of us can afford two or three hundred dollar shoes specially designed for specific tasks. My foot seems to be sliding outwards due to having wider feet than the shoe itself, so the treads can't hold my feet flat and stable, because of how the design is set. Outside of that, still a great buy and still worth the investment. Read more I ordered these shoes on a recommendation from a friend, and went out farther on the limb by ordering the shoe online. When I tried the shoes on they were tight enough that a shoe horn was extemely useful. Over use they've loosened up enough to slip on and off easy enough. While the tight fit was useful to keep stuff out of my shoes, the ratchet for the boa system took some abuse and clogged up quickly, so that if the shoe had been pulled off by the mud I wouldn't have been able to put them back on. They were awesome doubling as trail runners and continued to give me great traction through the obstacles. Read more I wanted to love these shoes. I have come to love the BOA functionality after using it on work boots for years. I researched running shoes that featured the BOA system and loved the styling of these. In the past I have bought wide-fit UA Valdez boots and found them to be fine, but the majority of their shoes just arent available in wide sizes. I tried these and was able to wear them for short periods and the BOA system performs admirably. These are just too narrow and I should have known better. Read more this shoe is amazing have ran and hiked in almost all other brands but this shoe provides traction, cushion, and stability in probably what is the lightest package delivered on the market today. The size is perfect I have always been between 12 and 13 depending on brand and finally a shoe company produces a half size that is perfect and from what it seems is sold out quickly. again great shoe I will say with great traction comes quick wear. i use new shoes in the winter when a lot of traction is needed and well broke in shoes in the summer. THESE SHOES WONT DISAPPOINT. my wife loves the women's fat tire 3 as well
Read more I have worn these shoes at work for two days, at a job where I am on my feet for over nine hours a day. So far they are fairly comfortable, better than the other athletic shoes I have tried to wear. They may get better as I get more used to them, but if not I think it will have more to do with my flat feet and diabetes, which after 26 years has had some effect on the feeling in my feet. I do like that the neoprene above the ankle found in the Fat Tire 2 has been removed. I like that this shoe has a tongue. I dont mind the lacing system like I thought I might; I actually quite enjoy it. Finally, this might sound silly, but I like the color combinationI bought the blue/black/yellow pairbecause I wear those color shirts to work on three of my four days, so the shoes match nicely. ?

But Asics can pretty much compete with any of them with their moderately priced shoes. The compression of the heel with my fingers felt nice - not too hard but not too soft. It is like running on sand - it may feel bouncy for the first few paces, but then it becomes very tiring. I'm not actually worried about the styling, as I will be beating them up pretty hard. They felt very good. The arch-support was adequate. The laces felt a bit on the short side if you use the top holes. I like to loop the laces through the topmost holes for a snug fit. Felt absolutely fantastic. They performed really well. But don't expect them to be great with the fall-leaves on the ground, and especially so, if they are wet after a rain. In short, they are great running shoes. Asics has done a wonderful job and they got a happy customer (again). Hope all you guys have a wonderful run as well on these. Read more One of the best pair of shoes I have ever put on my sore feet. To my amazement these babies were super comfortable right out of the box. Finally, a shoe that states it's a 4E is really a 4E, nice and wide....I love it. If you want a wide comfortable shoe, get these, you won't regret it. True to size, they look and feel great. I am very happy with these shoes. As a larger guy I am happy with the support. The Gel Contend 2 (the older version) started rubbing on the back of my ankle after about 200 miles of use but these have held up better. I liked the design of this shoe and the level of cushioning, which is just right for my activity level (treadmill walking, pavement or beach walking, and elliptical). I could have worn them in my proper size and they likely would have stretched out to be just right, but I didn't want to take the chance and not be able to return them. So I sent them back and bought a similar style, the Asics Gel Excite 4, which fit much better. I have used the Contend 1 successfully, and was expecting the same fit from the 3. My recommendation is for Asics to consider sizing future versions of this model like the original Contend 1. Otherwise it's a great shoe, one of the best budget models available. I am very happy with this shoe - especially the GEL cushioning which makes each step soft and easy. I would highly recommend this shoe to anyone looking for an extremely comfortable, high quality running shoe. Minor complaint is I normally wear a 13 3E from most other brands I've tried but needed to get a 14 4E in this shoe to get it to fit properly. I only rated a 4 because I have only checked them for fit. I have 3 other pair of Asics Kayano 19, and two pair of the Kayano 21 and they are the most comfortable running shoes I've ever used. I thought I'd try this pair which is on a lower tier but for the sale price that was offered by amazon I couldn't pass it up. And still worth it. Received these on time yeaterday afternoon, got up this morning and the weather was great, so I went for a run for PT. The first time I put these on I ran 3 miles, no issues. These are good shoes at a great price- very affordable and comfortable. They helped get me through Army Basic Training and have survived hundreds of miles of running, walking, sprinting, jogging, etc. Good fit, good feel.	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-GEL-Contend-Running-Shoe/dp/B071KY912Q?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B019BWMZPU&psc=1

Read more These are nice shoes for walking or people that spend the day on their feet. Saucony is my favorite brand and these are good, well made shoes, just wouldn't be my first choice for running. I own the following Saucony shoes and would highly recommend for runners who need motion control and good arch support: Hurricane 16, Stabil C3 and Guide 9. I don't recall any of them coming in black, plus they cost more than I needed to pay for casual wear. I usually order all my Saucony's one half larger size than my other shoes and they fit perfect. There's nothing wrong with the shoe, and it is actually pretty comfortable, but the description says gore-tex and this is not the gore-tex model. Never found a road shoe as good as the discontinued Jazz but between the Peregrine and the Excursion TR10 Saucony has the trails covered. Very nice. Amazing longevity, even on the hard rock hiking here in AZ.

The shoes still are in good shape. 5 days ago I would have listed their condition as great. The soles are still in great shape. The lifespan of these shoes are equal or better than any of their shoe if you don't mind the way they look after a while. The soles are still good. Read more First off Amazon asked if it provides good arch support. Review:
I first ordered a size 10, the same size as the Merrell Trail Glove 2 ( I own 6 pair of that model and love the fit). I then got a size 9.5 and the fit was much more of what I expected. Still a little more roomy than the Trail Glove 2 size 10 as far as width but the length of the Vapor Glove size 9.5 seemed the same as the Trail Glove size 10

What a great shoe though for everyday wear. Caution:
If you plan to use this shoe for running and you are not used to running in minimalistic shoes I would recommend short runs at first or easing into this shoe. I would recommend building any muscles that have been weakened by stiff running shoes first. Arch Support:
Everyone thinks of arch support differently so I really dont like the question. I have noticed most people confuse arch support with stability and motion control. Most people that want arch support really mean they want motion control or stability shoes. This has nothing to do with arch support. This shoes is completely flat and has no arch bump or motion control of any kind. A great minimalistic glove like shoe. Read more The original Vapor Glove was, and still is, a benchmark of excellence for minimalist shoes upon its release. The original vapor glove was lightweight, very flexible, provided a fantastic amount of ground feel, and had excellent traction with its vibram TC-1 sole. Thankfully, Merrell has decided to continue supporting its M-Connect shoes with a new iteration of the vapor glove, which is familiar, but still improves upon the original in many ways. The sole is largely the same, the weight is the same, and the stack height is also unchanged, but Merrell has overhauled the uppers with a slightly more flexible material that feels better than the scratchier uppers in the original. These were the areas most likely to tear in minimalist shoes and this reinforced section is a welcomed addition. It strikes the sweet spot between thinness, lightness,flexibility and durability that running enthusiasts are looking for. It's razor-cut sole is smooth enough for road running, yet provides enough traction for trails as well. The best analogy for the Vapor Glove would be a closed toe Vibram KSO EVO. The KSO EVO is easily the best Vibram shoe to date and the vapor glove is an excellent choice for those looking for all the strengths of the EVO, but in a closed toe form factor. The original Vapor Glove predates the KSO EVO by a year and it is clear that Vibram took notice of the Merrell shoe (which featured their sole) and updated the KSO with the Vapor Glove in mind. Overall, the vapor glove 2 is an amazing running shoe and is currently the best closed-toe minimalist shoe on the market for barefoot enthusiasts. For those looking to transition into minimalism, I would recommend the thicker Topo ST, Skora Fit, Bikila EVO, or Merrells' own Trail Glove 3, but if you a lover of barefooting, the Vapor Glove is only matched by the KSO EVO.

Please note that the sizing is slightly larger than expected, so size down .5 or one entire size for a perfect fit"	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Vapor-Glove-Trail-Running/dp/B00KZOBYYC?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00KZO4JV2&psc=1

My old 771's are great shoes, but they feel flatter and with less support and they don't give me a that forward roll feel, a great next step in my journey. The 771's have a wider footprint and help correct my ankles better, why change a good thing. I think next time I will visit a ""running store"" to make sure
Read more I will give this product 4.7 stars ... (I'm 1.83 mts height / 82 Kg weight)
- Great for concrete ans asphalt, not so much for trail.
- it feels like a glove, and it adapts really fine to your feet, also have great cushioning (for my weight)
- insole is ok, it have a great step position and the size was real for me. I'm 10.5, and 10.5 was perfect (not tight)
- in MY case, good for 21k as much ... more than that, and you feet will be overheated (I run on a city with 26-30 Celcius degrees everyday)
- The drop its ok, and Be aware that if there's to much heat on your running day wear thin socks to avoid blisters and cover your toes with a tape.
- after 6 months no more than 15k with this shoes because of the age-worn or attrition might affect your ligaments
- after 1 year the shoe sole is still ok, and if you're a regular runner, by changing the insoles you might use them for a few months more

Read more Ordered it as I couldn't find a 2e in store. I know these are more suited for running but I find light weight and flexible running shoes great for daily use. Fit perfect for a new pair of shoes. Pros
Light weight
2e width fits better than d
Cushioning is at par or better than the previous pair
Booty build provides better mid foot hold

Cons
Ankle bone is scrapped with side upper on the right foot
A bit of burning sensations
Color pattern could be better - female version for same grey pair looks better. Read more I used Amazon's fit estimator and so far these fit and feel great. I have about 50 miles on them, and they're holding up nicely. I did get them super cheap, so I'm extremely happy, even if the pink-orange color is a little weird. These are (I think) 6mm and make my gait much easier and more natural. Read more I have to say I am extremely impressed with the comfort and style of these shoes. More often than not I am hesitant in ordering shoes after reading reviews and getting mixed suggestions on the sizing. From my point of view, I always have trouble finding comfortable shoes because I am someway flat footed and have an active lifestyle. So being comfortable in my shoes all day is priority over the look, however I don't feel I sacrificed either of the qualities with this pair. They are more fitted to my foot rather than tight and that's the fit I prefer for my shoes. I highly recommend a pair if you spend a lot of time on your feet during the day or even for athletic purposes. The *neon'ish* color is relatively bright, just for the heads up but that's why I liked them. Hope my review helps you decide if this is the right shoe for you. They were for my 15 yr old son, I have buying new balance sneakers since he was a baby and have never ever had a problem with fit or quality before this, but the top layer of blue over the mesh is all peeling off.

Now mind you there are also three more VERY important attributes which I am looking for in a shoe which in my view Reebok hasn't quite arrived there yet: durability and overall comfort while maintaining light/minimalist profile. Enter the Inov-8 X-Talon 225-U: So far, these shoes have measured up very well to my standards in an OCR shoe. I've awarded 4 stars to this point because I've only worn them at a Spartan Super Race (8.5 mile) since my purchase. The event itself brought these shoes to the test as it had poured rain the night before as well as the day of the event. The mud was considerably deep yet my feet stayed securely strapped in, (good lacing system). I did notice the lugs are slightly longer than the Reebok's Super OR and they seem to have better traction on wet wood. I do enjoy the lightweight feel of the shoe and comfort is not sacrificed. Running felt very comfortable no matter what the surface was. Which leads to post race clean up - simply done with a garden hose and some hang time (drying). I'm separating this line because it is important to understand that FIVE STARS would be my rating if these shoes can prove to last the remainder of my race season. I still have another Spartan Trifecta, TougherMudder, and a FIT challenge to bring these puppies through before the end of this year. Overall construction of the shoe was good and I am sure if I had had the time to return and reorder in a larger size they would have worked great for my event, but I was unable to get them in time to properly train and prepare. Wore my in in the Tuff Medder TX, Awesome traction through 99% of the events. Very little debris collected inside and never had to stop and adjust the shoe through the entire event. Compared to my friends Merrills, no removable insole. These seem very durable and cleaned up quickly another nice feature of the removable insole. Great shoe of mud races. Best for off road, as some of the running on paved portions, I could feel the lugs on the bottom of my feet. they are a nice pair but half a size fit too small and too narrow for me. i was going to send it back but decided to give it to my best friend for our zion trip. im sad i couldnt wear them because i run wider and the shoe fits too snug. i ordered a 6.5 size US womens and normally thise fit fine with my merrel and nike brands. in this case, a 7 size US womens might have worked better. i think they look great, the quality is durable and they are comfortable. they are light and flexible great for trails. i just wish i had them slightly wider and half a size bigger. I just ran my first race in these shoes which have amazing traction, but the rubber is already starting to peel away after 1 run. This might not be the shoe for everyone but I love it myself. The fit leaves no room for you feet to slide or move at all. It took me one run to fall in love with this shoe. Ran a muddy, slick and wet trail and didn't lose any traction. Up and over the hills and down a very rocky and steep hill and felt very confident in these shoes. Only 3 runs in so far but truly love them and can't wait for my first race in April to see how I do. The material is perfect for mud races. Very sturdy and has a very good traction even on loose ground and on ropes. The shoe fits me well. I suggest to use the EU size as refernce in the chart instead of US. My size is 39 in EU but the nearest sizing is 39.5 and it fits perfectly. I took the advice of other reviewers, I ordered a half size larger, they fit well to my feet. But so far, Im liking em	https://www.amazon.com/Inov-8-X-talon%C2%99-225-Trail-Runner/dp/B01B25B85M?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01BDU7ZYE&psc=1

NeoShell® uppe']	"Overall, I think they are pretty good, but they still have some issues that hopefully will be fixed in the 4.0 version coming out in August 2018. Good for rain and cold weather...too hot for warm weather

Pros
- Typical Altra fit, same size as my escalantes, torrins. The newer 3.5's require sizing up 1/2 size, while these did not for me
- Good fit, ample toe box, even a larger than normal
- Decent traction

Cons
- Waterproofing works pretty well, but after 8 of 10 miles in pouring rain they started to leak a little, still not bad
- A little warm for summer running, but in the rain they work well. Fitting is good with this size adjustment and bit of intel. I love their shoes, the zero drop platform, the light weight cushioning, the feel is awesome and will not go back to conventional shoe platform. I just wish that Altra would recognize that many folks would like their shoes much more if they did a ""wide"" size. These shoes were very comfortable. Plenty of room in the toe box (I wear a size 8.5-9W in womens shoes and I bought a size 8 in Mens)  there was about 1/2 inch of extra room from toe to front of shoe (which is needed for downhill hiking); the width on these was perfect and allowed me to wear them immediately (no break-in time required). I hope it doesnt get caught on things on future hikes - I may try to superglue it back on the toe of the shoe. Overall, comfortable. Read more I've worn these shoes on regular cold weather daily runs on regular asphalt pavement and on my local boardwalk and they just felt fine, nicely cushioned but still good road feel. I love the way the wide toebox leaves lots of room for my hammer-toe, strangely shaped feet while the rest of of the shoe body comfortably hugs my feet. Footing was secure and comfortable the whole time. With thin wool hiking socks after an hour my feet were still warm and dry. They do take a bit of getting used to if you've never worn zero drop shoes before, at first your calves may feel tight so read the tips in the box and do a few shorter runs and try to be conscious of altering your stance and foot landing. Read more Altra makes some great shoes, I own 4 different styles, including a previous version of this exact shoe, which I love; warm, water resistant, wide toe box. Also the grey/red color is a much darker grey than it appears in the pics. Read more I bought these shoes (way in advance) in anticipation of a trip to a wet, winter location. I wear flip-flops 80% of the time here in Oregon but opt for ""real shoes"" when it rains or gets below 40F during my daily walks. (I'm an obsessive walker and get the best footwear that I can since I'm on my feet a lot--I've averaged over 8.6 miles a day for 14+ years.) We have been in drought conditions in 2018 and had our first major rain fall in November. I eagerly put on my new pair of Lone Peak 3.0 Neoshell Trail Running shoes to get a real ""walking in the rain"" test. On the good side, these shoes are extremely comfortable for me (and remember, my feet really hate shoes). The no-drop shoe style emulates my flip-flop's ""no-drop heel"" that I'm used to and the wide toe box is fabulous since my feet are ""spread out"" (from seldom being constricted by shoes).

Was easily a 1/2 size larger than the 9.5 4s I have and love. Honestly, these looked like they belonged on an 80s toy figurine.

Comfort is high for myself but I have high arches, so high that if my feet are wet and I stand on concrete my prints are two separate prints with a gap between the heel and toes. Read more Great minimalist running shoe. One of my favorite Merrells ever. I ordered the 5s thinking this was improved. The TG5s arch support is now higher than ever. It feels like someone stuck a rubber ball in the arch área the moment you start walking in then. I always felt the TG4s were just a little too tight in the toe area, but I feel like they became too wide in the TG5s. I ended up going with Merrell Vapor Glove shoes for running and my feet are very happy in those. I really was hoping the TG5 would of fixed the high arch area. Both the TG4 and TG5 have great tread patterns ideal for the trials. The arch support is WAY too high and extends across the entire width of the foot. The previous Trail Glove 4 was so much better feeling and higher quality materials.

UPPER: Quick-dry Air Mesh', '', '']	I came from using Altra Escalantes for the last 400 miles or so, and these shoes have now replaced the Escalantes as my favorite all-around shoe. I am a long distance runner dealing with mild pronation-related pain on one of my feet, and I tried and loved this shoe precisely for those two purposes. It provides a good slightly contoured footbed for just the right amount of support including around the arch, but it's flexible enough that you can still feel the road under your feet. The cushion is squishy but springy and responsive, keeping my feet feeling fresh all the way through yesterday's 18-mile run. They also feel surprisingly light for the amount of cushion they have. The mesh upper is breathable enough that it keeps my feet relatively dry and fresh. The toe box is the typical Altra style, shaped like your foot and oh-so-comfortable. I can't wear many other shoes now since I switched to Altras about 6 months ago because they have allowed my toes to spread out and take their natural unshod shape. I like them so much that I just ordered another pair of these to use as my day-use shoes and as an occasional running backup to my first pair of Paradigms. Read more I had the original Paradigm which fit my foot very well. The old Paradigms were great and we're wide enough in the toe box and fore foot to fit my feet and had plenty of cushion. This is the third version and although a different design for the top and the sole is more reinforced, it's also more narrow in the forefoot and for me is too small. Where the old version had my foot comfortably sitting on the platform, this one pushes in with my foot basically hanging over the edge on the inside. If you don't have problem feet that are extra wide but looking for a high cushion shoe with toe room then this is a good fit for you. By far my favorites have been the 2.0. The mesh on upper body on these feels cheap, and really the color makes me feel like I am wearing an old pair of New Balance shoes. The first time I slipped these on the heel cushion behind my Achilles pushed down and folded over, now I cannot get it back into place without cutting a hole in my shoes. I love Altra shoes, and the Paradigms have been my favorite thus far, but the 3.0 has thrown me from the name, and I will be skeptical about buying another pair. Avoid these like the plague and find a pair of 2.5s. Read more The most comfortable shoes I ever wore. I purchased my first pair at a local running shop for walking on the treadmill and wore them for about two weeks when they started sounding like they were sticking to the floor and treadmill belt. They credited my account and I ordered the same model and size from Amazon.com. Amazon didn't offer an exchange for size so they're going back for a refund. Had two pair of the Paradigm 2 which I loved but wore out over a 1 1/2 years (normal wear) and had to purchase Paradigm 3. Less support in footbed although Paradigm is model for maximum cushioning. Not sure where to go from here but definitely NOT giving Altra anymore of my $125.00-150.00 for shoes that are technically and design not sound. At first he thought they looked funny due to the slightly unorthodox shape as they are designed to best fit your feet. When he put them on, he quickly changed his mind about them, with some encouragement from one of our sons who was visiting at the time, and has been wearing them ever since. They have a great insole that can be removed for your own, if necessary. They absorb impact and are just an above average quality shoe overall, well worth over the budget $$ I spent. He needs the support and being diabetic, taking care of your feet is imperative. I highly recommend the Altra AFM1739F Men's Paradigm 3 Road Running Shoe.

637	7	Altra Superior 3.0	['Quick Dry Air Mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Removable insole']	"Abbreviated review: The Altra Superior is best running shoe I've ever worn. Also very comfortable for walking. Very comfortable. Feet have enough room to spread out which feels great (I have moderately wide forefoot and regular heel). Good shock absorption. The last in this shoe fits me like a glove. Good trail feel, but still have enough cushion and protection from sharp rocks, even with rock plate removed. In comparison to some other shoes:
Nike Terra Kiger: A friend recommended the Terra Kiger a few years ago so I bought a pair and ran in them for a bit. They were a bit too soft and unstable in comparison to the Superior. I also prefer a zero drop shoe like the Altra which seems to provide a more natural foot strike that absorbs shock better. Altra Lone Peak: The Lone Peak is a narrower last, shape: SD6-M. Didn't fit me as well, but may be a great shoe for a different foot than mine. Looking forward to many adventures in these Superiors. This is an unfortunate, avoidable issue with an otherwise fantastic shoe. It is easily to fix with a little mole skin and duct tape. I changed my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars and the title from the"" best shoe ever"" to a ""promising shoe.""
Read more I purchased these shoes as I was planning for a 3 day hike in an area with well established trails--the Porcupine Mountains (The Porkies) in the U.P. Of Michigan. Mostly mention were the comfort, zero drop, and wide toe box that people said becomes very important as the day and the distance covered progresses. I chose these shoes based upon the word of others and the reviews here on Amazon. I wore them everywhere and went on two hikes over 5 miles....and loved them. I thought for sure my feet were going to be blistered and sore ( was carrying about 40lbs as well), but to my surprise, I totally forgot my feet were wet, and the shoes felt dry by trail's end. I was so amazed I told myself I would order another pair of these before they stopped making this model. The trip was fantastic...but I was a bit bummed on the 2nd day when I noticed one of my shoes had a rip in the rubber at the toe...where the sole meets the top front of the shoe. Will try the Amazon seller tomorrow and update this post. Read more This is the best zero-drop trail shoe I've ever found. I always loved the Lone Peak, but it had a few flaws (stress areas on the upper always ripped, and the traction pattern of the sole left a lot to be desired. I decided to give the Superior 3s a try - bingo. And the tread is outstanding for trail running. The thickness of the mid-sole is actually more like my Lone Peak 1.0s than the newer Lone Peaks were so, in effect, what I ended up with was an updated/improved version of my favorite shoe. This is like a Lone Peak 1.0, but with the upper-splitting problem solved and with a much better tread pattern. As I couldn't trust that brand and shoe, I opted to go for Altra (my road shoes are the Torins), and wow!. I put in one 10km run before the race and they felt good so I used them--12hrs and 45 mins on my second run. No foot pain, no blisters, great traction, held up great. I hope they hold up with more kms as these will be my go-to shoes for the foreseeable future!"	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01HNL5A9O/ref=asc_df_B01HNL5A9O1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01HNL5A9O&linkCode=asn&psc=1

This is the most comfortable barefoot/minimalist shoe I've ever worn. Well, I don't have huge experience with barefoot shoes... but these are awesome. Super comfy. I don't really run in these, I have a set of ON that I use for beating up the pavement, but these are awesome at work and picking up and putting down heavy lumps of metal. I love these so much I've bought several more pairs just to rotate for distance training. The tongueless shoe design is brilliant and should be incorporated into every shoe ever... easiest shoes to slip on and off and still fit snug (buy half a size smaller than your normal size). For me, the fit is perfect, and true to size. The Trail Glove 4 shoe provides much better foot protection then the other 2 and 3 models and the weight is the same, within a few grams. The materials and the overall construction appear to be far superior too my model 2 and 3 shoes, although only time and miles will prove this out. These Trail glove 4 shoes provide better stability and better tractionthan the 2 or 3 models, as well. I run about 35 miles per week and this is one of the most comfortable running shoes I have worn. The unique 1-sided tongue stays perfectly in place, wrapped around your foot. Great job Merrell. These shoes force you to run in a more efficient, almost barefoot, way. These trail gloves fit perfectly. They have a heel cup that hugs but doesnt pinch or rub. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. Its like wearing bread bags on your feet. I also dont like the burrito tongue. Amazing sneakers. He is 56 and needs good shoes for these events. I wanted to order another pair for him, but amazing is out of his size. Great product As always, I am a skeptic. But when these shoes were sinched up, I was pleasantly surprised by their light weightless and rugged soles.

Gone are the days of having to sacrifice space for a good pair of cushioned shoes and not be able to wear them for anything but fitness related activities. The only other thing I would hope changes is that they switch to a 4mm drop vs the 6mm for more of a mid foot strike like the zantes. Please keep making the colors and styling that make these shoes look more like ""fashion"" sneakers. The other shoes for trail/road runner like myself that doesn't want to have three separate pair of running shoes are the Hoka Challenger
ATRs. I am very negatively impressed. I did not purchase them for trail running but they do have an alright amount of grip if someone were to go on a dry/moist dirt trail they'd be fine. First test run I ran 3 miles on the side walk, road and some grass and they felt great. Very light and responsive when transitioning from flat to uphill or around sharp corners. Downhill they also gave good support and cushioning. I bought 11.5 but I don't think even 12 would be comfortable. Both pairs of NB shoes were extremely tight compared to the usual fit I've experienced. Not meant for technical or extremely muddy trails, neither has a rock-plate for super sharp rocky surfaces. Light & nice looking shoe but runs small and narrow. Usually I wear a 11.5 and purchased a 12 but now wish I had 12.5. No arch support and very cheap/thin insoles which is unusual for a running shoe. After two months of casual use I am downgrading my review to 2 stars.

Now for the skechers R2 ..i just got it iut of the box ..and took it for a quick 10 km..it was great..the shoes is responsive ..coshion...stiff but comfortable in the same time ..the forefoot is not as wide as the ultra 4 ...but still not narow. Really like these shoes. Always like the GoRun series but I needed more cushion for long runs over half marathon. The first version of the Ultra R was little heavy so I used Hoka Clifton 2 and Clayton for the last 3 marathons and they are only ok to me. So far I've done about 40 miles in these shoes and they feel fantastic, comparable amount of cushion and weight to the Clifton 2 but the ride is much more natural. These had by far the best cushioning/stability and value for the money. For You narrow-footed people - buy these - you won't regret it. If they start making wides, WATCH OUT for Skechers. love these shoes so much, i placed an order for another pair.

I wanted to like this shoe based on reviews of friends. I tried a half size larger hoping the extra room would give some additional comfort. I just love my Hoke One running shoes. These are my sixth pair and I love them all. I have every shoe known to man and to me, they are most comfortable shoe ever, especially for a bigger guy. Toe box a little tight but like running on a cloud. Absolute perfect racing shoe for my marathon.

They are the most comfortable shoe I have ever tried on or wore. I wish I could return these shoes and get a different shoe, especially for the price I paid. My husband absolutely loves these for both weight lifting and cardio. Originally, he was a fan of Nike Free sneakers, and these were recommended as an alternative. He likes them even better. He says they're the perfect mixture of being a natural and supportive shoe. I love these shoes. As a matter of fact I love them so much I ordered a second grey pair. They feel great. Just wish the right ones would deliver. These shoes are awesome. Bought them for my daughter and she has raved about how comfortable they are... run a teensy bit small so we ordered 1/2 size larger. She says they fit like a glove - like she's not wearing shoes. I personally own 4 pairs of these shoes, I love them so much.

650	20	Altra Olympus 2.0	['100% Quick Dry Air Mesh', 'Imported', 'Vibram sole', 'Ideal uses include trail running, hiking, fastpacking, trail racing', 'Trail specific sticky rubber', 'Dual layer ethylene vinyl acetate with A-Bound top layer', '5 millimeter contour footbed', 'GaiterTrap technology']	The Shoefitr recommended size 10.5 versus my Torin 2.0 size 10. Sizing is definitely smaller than Torin, so while the Olympus 10.5 might be slightly bigger than what I hoped for, I reckon size 10 would have been too small for me. The insoles were also thick and cups the heel well. The lugs are widely spaced out which won't retain dirt and I think this would make for a good transition from road to trail. The outsole is super grippy and cushioning is so comfortable, yet responsive. Grip is still good but will probably have to retire them as trail shoes and use then for road and light trails by 500km. The responsiveness if the cushioning is still very good at this point. Lugs wear is still acceptable and the Megagrip outsole still has good grip. The cushioning is still cushy and responsive. Not much upper wear an tear as well. The biggest positive is the outsole - it is super durable and has tons of traction. I am a mid-foot striker, and weigh over 200lbs, so the shoe has taken some abuse, but I expected better lasting material for the premium price point. The Olympus is a comfy, highly cushioned shoe, is zero drop, and has a roomy toebox which allows natural toe splay. It is heavy, but that is a choice and a trade off for other benefits. I love the Vibram outsole, but otherwise, the Altra Olympus 2 falls short in my opinion. I am a Altra fan. I have had previous Olympus shoes and love them. I love the max cushion they have. I wish Altra would come out with a max cushion all black leather shoe. I am a firefighter and they would keep me comfortable all day. I highly recommend these shoes. If you bought these while on sale for $90 with free shipping then it was a decent price, but it's harder to justify the $150 retail price. Initial impression : They're a little short at front toes, but that should be ok during normal running. The fit feels good overall, if a little snug in forefoot. The stack height of the sole is noticeable but not a problem. The Blue/Green color scheme : it's sort of ugly, but that's ok. The shoe breaks in quickly and is comfortable. The extra padding means you feel the ground less and it's easier to let your form slip. This can be harder on your joints and less efficient, so running in them requires a little more mindful attention. Generally they appear to be holding up well. On each shoe there is a growing hole where the upper part of the shoe is stitched into the sole, located on the inner fore-foot	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Olympus-Trail-Running/dp/B013LKMNO6?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B013LKJGPA&psc=1

The lugs are very responsive and I felt it helped me run faster. The 2mm offset helps you to run in more natural and better running form; much better calf workout, and I have not felt any knee pains or discomfort on my feet after long runs (unlike some other shoes with higher offsets); also absolutely no blisters for me even after many long runs. Also, I selected fits as expected, since for running shoes, I usually buy 1 size bigger, and did the same with Newton, and that fits me perfectly. (Only wish there were few more choices for colors!) I selected fits as expected because Newton Running recommended to go up a 1/2 size and I did. Im normally a 12 and the 12.5 fits me perfectly. My fist pair of Newtons was in 2011 and I was moderately pleased with them although they had a perceptible different feel between the left and the right. I have to say that this is the first pair of running shoes that Ive ever owned that were perfect for me in, every way, from the moment I put them on to now having finished 25 miles on the road and on the track. I definitely feel faster and so are my splits. Great great shoe. This shoe is perfect. I love my Newtons and this is probably my favorite pair. They fit true to size (I'm men's 10). These shoes are light, but also give more stability and support unlike the Newton Distance Elites. These are light and comfortable. I've got 320 miles on them so far and they're holding up well. One shoe smaller than the other ... defective product Absolutely love them. I love Newtons but why cant they figure out a way to keep shoe sizes consistent from year to year	https://www.amazon.com/Newton-Running-Mens-Distance-7/dp/B0767FC45S?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B079C5VWKX&psc=1

Not sure of how many miles, but they were OK for only 2 months whereas other brands I can get 3 - 4 months out of them with a good amount of mileage. Not great but not bad. (The Asics Foundation 8s are a 5.) I really liked the original Wave Alchemy a lot, which were a close second to the Foundation 8s. These have a weird heel strike and transition, almost like your foot touches down and then goes clack! as it rolls forward. Other reviewers have noted this as well. This shoe is definitely a ""maximalist"" shoe. The heels felt like they were tipping me forward. On the positive side, the midsole was rigid, and the cushioning was excellent; I had no foot or heel pain. Now, they are comfortable, although they are still heavier than I would like. I wish I had ordered a 12.5. Overall, a good but very aggressive shoe, but it definitely helped prevent flare-ups of plantar fascitis. I wouldn't wear them for racing, but if you need the stability, these are good shoes. I have owned a number of Neutral/Stability shoes, I've tried Brooks, New Balance, and Hoka One One shoes, and I haven't found any that fit as well as the Mizunos, and the Wave Paradox is no different. I've had these out on 5 occasions now, all over 5 miles, and have had good support and when I'm finished, my feet don't hurt and my knees don't hurt (this is a big deal for me, I've got bad arthritis, and these have really helped so far. If anything changes on the durability of these shoes, I will update my post, but so far, these are great. Happy Running. SIGNIFICANTLY and I had the older mizuno shoes from about 5 years ago that helped with these so I needed a replacement bad. these are even more supportive I feel then my last ones as the inner arch and heel are definitely beefier (which makes the shoe totally look goofy, but I don't care, it allows me to run for more than 3 miles without knee pain. aside from that they actually breath very well, and I could probably wear them all day, BUT I just wear them for running as that is when I would actually have pain. Definitely runs a half size smaller and a size narrower. Great support. I have issues with plantar fasciitis and general foot pain due to excessive pronation but the stability of this shoe helps immensely. Works great with my Superfeet insert. I run distances of 4-6 miles at least every other day and these shoes provide adequate support for, at least, the first couple miles. Outside of that, these shoes feel nice on the foot. They did not have as much cushion under the ball of the foot as I had hoped. The toe also has a little piece of leather that is on top, over the mesh, and my toe hit it, because my toes lift when I walk."	https://www.amazon.com/Mizuno-Mens-Wave-Paradox-Running/dp/B00R1HNZVQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00SMRXG3G&psc=1

And I wasn't even hiking or running (intended purpose of the shoe) I know I will never be able to glue them together as they shoes use special adhesives that you can not find at the HomeDepot or Lowes. I URGE YOU NOT to buy or if you do check them out really quick , check the soles, check the glued stuff, check the integrity and asses based on experience if they will hold for whatever activity you will put them trough. ASICS Men's Gel-Scram 3 Trail Runner, Indigo Blue/Silver/India Ink, 10 M US My son really loved the style and the comfort and the right fit but in the 2nd week of wearing it part of the sole peeled off during running!. Had to return it The grip and tread life so far have been great. They are very comfortable and feel great even after a sloppy run. Thankfully I work where I can get industrial strength epoxy to repair the now over 75% of the tread pads that have come undone. I would imagine a good crazy/super glue would work also. Super comfortable for a short, 230 lb dude like me. One star removed: the grips on these sound like cleats when walking on a hard surface like a department store or in the tiled office at work. These were definitely designed for the backwoods trails (and they are in fact marketed as such, so I shouldnt complain) Great shoes..nice feeling and cushion,i always get my running or gym shoes half size larger or one size larger,cause i want my foot to have these extra space and be comfy..Asics is the best brand out there,cannot switch to another..been with me for so many years..!!. I like these shoes for hiking, this is my second pair. I wear size 14 in ASICS, and they fit consistently. For that reason all my shoes are ASICS. I like the cushioning of this sole for rocky trails and the traction for steep, slippery slopes. I agree the tread design could be more reliable. I don't know if it's style or skimping on an expensive material, but they really shouldn't glue little bits of tread on like that, they are going to be prone to peeling off. However, I have had not had that problem personally, so 5 stars. I purchased ASICS Men's Gel-Scram 3 Trail Runner for my son and he loves them. He tried them on and they fit as expected since we had ASICS before. We used these for trail running and they did awesome. The colors are vibrant and even better when the kid thinks they look cool. I would recommend these one on amazon since we need them other places on line for a much higher price.	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-scram-Trail-Runner/dp/B017SH74LK?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FY8HXNY&psc=1

It seems that every time a company makes a shoe that is perfect for me, they inevitably screw it up with a revision. Fit is great (better than the 11s for me), and right now I'm more concerned with minimizing impact than with squeezing out every bit of pace, so the tradeoff is worth it for me, and I'd say these are my favorite yet. The level of medial support is IMO the same as previous Inspires. I've been running in Inspires since the Inspire 5 and these are very different and much worse than any other iterations. I've always loved the lightness, breathability, and flexibility of these shoes. They are awesome. Lightweight, incredibly fast feeling, and fit perfectly - everything i loved about the Inspires. Will have to try the Inspire 13s in the future, but the 12's were definitely not for me. These were on sale and a special Amazon coupon day made this purchase a no-brainer. I run 3 days - 20 miles a week, and at least one half marathon every year for the past 6 years, and these have been the best so far. A co-worker recommended either the Wave Inspire (WI) or Wave Runner (WR). I ordered both but the Wave Inspire came in first. I tend the heel strike but also needed some forefoot cushioning as well..and these are perfect. From what I've read the difference between these two most popular models are that the WI have a slightly more cushy feel forefoot and the WR having more heel cushioning..so there you go. I can attest today after doing our WOD and some running that the cushy forefoot (wearing the WI) that it is truly appreciated. If you are likely to spend time on your forefoot area, these are perfect. I didn't really notice the heel of the WI being stiff..feel great too..looking forward to trying out the WR when they come in. As far as quality goes, the WI are solid. They looked bulky at first, but they are LIIIGHT. Also I really like that the tongue was small and not these huge flap that always seems to move around..it's a small tongue. One thing is that I wish the laces were a tad longer as I utilize the heel lock holes and that tends to use more of the laces. Some reviews have said that the toe area was narrow..not at all..I have what I would consider on the average-wide side and they are roomy perfect. If you are looking to get a pair of REAL running/workout shoes..these are it..you will not regret it. Read more Love these shoes, although it did take a little break in to get used to them. Mizuno Wave Inspires have a firmer cushioning than I am used to, but I got used to the firmer cushioning. After working out a couple of times in them, I realized my miles times were faster on average, and my legs were not as tired. Seems like the energy return is better than what was stated in a lot of the reviews I have read. I tried Mizuno wave inspire 12. Really good fit and much lighter than Kayano. I'll recommend these shoes for long distance stability run. I purchased these for my husband who needed a new pair after his old pair of Wave Inspire 12s needed to be retired.

Not necessarily a criticism of the sneakers if you get the correct size, but beware if ordering on line. these are amazing! exactly as described...great fit through the waist buy plenty of room for your toes to splay. Comfy but no support in the sole. They fit well, feel comfortable over a long period and seem to well very well over a year of use. Exactly as described, fit was accurate. Very pleased. Definitely a manufacturer defect. Great customer service. Giving this one extra star because customer service was very responsive. Great for wide feet. Wide like Birkenstocks. Hope this helps. I bought these shoes primarily for trail running and over the last 9 months have run over 350 miles in them on Arizona mountain trails, including a Rim to Rim to Rim run of the Grand Canyon. The fit is excellent, wide roomy toe box and a great heal lock. The shoe stays put, fits well, and is comfy for many miles and long days. The upper breathes well and barely showed any wear and tear.

These were cheap thin cotton laces that look like the kind that used to come with kids' shoes back in the 70's. Second, the shoes run much smaller than the ""regular"" GT 2000's. A very snug fit and I had to order a half size up. Finally, but most importantly, the shoes started to develop a hold in the heel after less than 50 miles of use. I do a lot of mountain running where the footing can be tricky, and I just feel much more secure in the street gt-2000. I have worn Asics for years, including the GT Trail Runners, and they have always fit my feet perfectly (Size 13). I have now switched to the Asics Fuji Endurance, which feels much better on my feet than this version of the GT-2000. It is possible the GT-2000 I received was a counterfeit, since it fit so differently than every other Asics I have ever tried. Regardless, I found the Fuji Endurance (still by Asics) a much better fit for my feet. Decent shoes, at a good price. Not Asics highest quality shoe, but good for casual workouts and walking around.

I do like the Nike Zoom Structure 19 shoes, those have Ortholite insoles but the next layer under it is more rubbery/shock absorbing, so the net effect is shock absorption but a little firmness, softer than Brooks Ghost 9 but firmer than Asics GT-2000 v.4 and v.5

So then if you like a lightweight, flexible shoe that has good ankle support and foot stability, but very very soft cushioning, these could work for you. I really liked the appearance too, darn it. Soft, snug, and pretty slick in terms of looks. The shoes are lighter than other models, which might explain why the cushioning felt harder, while more runners prefer a lighter shoe, I like a bit of weight so really that's up to your personal preference

It fits comfortably, which is more than I can say about other brands who offer a lot of technology in their shoes but dont offer them in my size (I have to upsize all the damn time because shoe brands dont sell them to fit my tiny feet, and they dont offer professional high grade shoes to children because they think they'll outgrow them). They *feel* durable, but I need to wear them out for another hundred miles or so

I give it 4 Stars instead of my average 3 because of the cost I paid for them ($55 + Tax), so it's pretty good for the price I paid
Read more I have very flat feet. I need a shoe that give me support.I liked the Gel Kayanos and on a Blabk Friday deal tried the Surveyor-5. One month in, love them. More cushy than Gel Ksyano, But not so cushy that it lacks support. If they hold up for a couple more months, Im officially a fan. Oh, what I like least. I would say that this shoe is the closest in terms of comparable shoe width, fit and cushioning. Hopefully, this is helpful to anyone looking to match this previous model. He needs a stability shoe and these have worked out great for him so far. He has only ran a few miles in them so far but can tell they are nice and high quality shoes. My son is the top runner on his high school cc team and jogged around the house in them. He seems to think he wants to give them a try next time as well because of how comfortable they were. I have had issues with my feet and Asics are the best shoes I have found. These shoes take away heel pain I was having and are he best show I could find. I don't run in them and like to wear them to work. With that said the Gel-Surveyor 5 was very comfortable except for an area right at the bend of my toes that felt like a hump running across from side to side but after about a mile it was hardly noticeable and once I buy different insoles that should disappear totally. I look forward to breaking in the Surveyors and expect theyll get even more comfortable. He went with these and has been happy so far a couple 3-4 mile runs per week. He has very flat feet and over pronates, these shoes provide a good amount of support and good cushioning, plus they feel lightweight. If youre a fan of the Kayanos, but looking for a cheaper option... these might be for you!"	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-Gel-Surveyor-Running-Shoe/dp/B01GU7B9LK?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FY8HXNO&psc=1

Through several mud sections I felt reasonably stable. Overall very happy. This is my eighth pair of Hokas and as with all the others, they are perfect for the purpose for which they were designed. Tha ATR 3 is ideal for trail running with the thicker more lug-like sole. I wore them right out of the box on an eight mile run(intended only 3)and they were comfortable and very stable. The toe box is a little roomier than past versions which has always been an issue for those of us with wide feet that like the Hoka feel. Overall, I like these shoes. I'm always reluctant to buy shoes online as it seems like no two pairs ever fit the same. The shoes are nice quality, but just a bit more snug than I expected. I had an earlier generation of Hoka of the same size, and they fit better. A nice shoe though. These are by far the best pair of running shoes I've ever owned. Perfect for either trail or road It's like running on pillows, they don't have the wider toe area like Altras do...but they have more cushion, in my opinion. I run through rocky, hilly terrain and the ride of these shoes are great. The ride is easy and smooth, I can hardly feel any of the rocks on the trail, and I'm close to 200 lbs. They also have surprising grip on the trail as well. Well Done HOKA!

676	16	Saucony Kinvara 7	['synthetic-and-mesh', 'Saucony', 'Mens Shoes', 'White', 'SYNTHETIC-AND-MESH', 'Running']	"I ran 10 mi the first day I got them and let me begging by saying, ""I LOVE THIS SHOES"" I had 2 Kinvara 5 and one Kinvara 6, so if you are coming from a Saucony Kinvara you will love this shoe. For me, I was more impressed with the K7 than I have ever been with any other Kinvara. They fill responsive, very light, well made and for some reason they seems to be more durable. All and all very good shoe. So if you are looking for a natural running shoe, that is light, yet responsive, don't hesitate and buy one of these, you will never regret it. Love this shoe. Much better than the Kinvara 6, and from the reviews it appears that the Kinvara 8 has been made narrower again (like the 6), so I bought extra pairs to tide me over until Saucony comes to their senses again. This is the perfect shoe for the forefoot running style many are advocating these days, as it is relatively flat from heel for forefoot. In fact, I like it better than the Newton shoe, which was specifically designed for this running style. These shoes have held up beautifully. 60+ miles a week through streets, grass, gravel, rain, and on the treadmill. The black color has started to fade a bit and the tread on the distolateral portion of outsole has all but eroded but I still use them for trail runs. 700+ miles, and like Russell Westbrook in the playoffs, ""he will not die!"" Obviously, if you are a heal striker I would advise switching out at half that mileage since you dont have your Achilles tendon taking the majority of the impact. Fit: My 2nd digit of my left foot is slightly longer than it is on the left and would normally be comfortable in a size 11 depending on the brand of shoes but with the roomy toebox they fit perfectly on both my left and right foot. Grip: Works great on the track, road, and works superbly in the rain. Overall: I know, just like Oakley's, the prices are fixed and rarely drop but they are the Crown Victoria of running shoes. Read more Loved the shoe. I had no issues during longer runs and they are very comfortable. These shoes felt great on various terrain -- concrete, asphalt, dirt, gravel. I do need to note that before reaching 100 miles on the shoes, the mini-pads on the soles started to coming off. I personally think they are pointless and a weak point in the design, but I'm sure Saucony isn't the only one who does this. I'm hoping these fair better than on the 7s. Overall, a good shoe and one I would put on my GoTo list even with the mini-pad issue. Good neutral shoe for running, pretty good for walking too. 4mm drop seems accurate. No arch support but it's not supposed to have that. Other than that it fits well. Which is a bummer because I love an excuse to buy new shoes... Overall does what it's supposed to overall, and doesn't look crazy, so they will retire and still be useful. Also does just fit a large sized Powerstep insole, if you need that. I just switched to the Kinvara 7s and found them not quite as supportive as I expected from a shoe that is touted as one of the best for plantar fasciitis sufferers, but they are comfortable nonetheless. Compared to the Grid Cohesions and numerous other popular running shoes, they are extremely light, balanced in the sole, and just enough wider in the toe box to allow for a comfortable spread and natural footfall. Little to no break-in time doesn't hurt either. All in all, I'm pleased so far. I really like the comfort and weight of the kinvara 7. It felt like I was putting on gloves rather than running shoes. Despite their lightness, I felt my high arches were well supported and didn't have any flare-up of plantar fasciitis, which can occur if I use shoes with too little arch support. What remains to be seen is whether they hold up well with my weight over 170 lbs. I still expect to use my Saucony Guide 10s for longer training runs over 13 miles, but will definitely consider using these for my next half-marathon. These are the best Saucony Kinvara series shoes that I have bought so far, the fit is better. very lightweight"	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Kinvara-Running-Shoe/dp/B01N2B6Z2W?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B010AHQY7A&psc=1

I easily solved this issue by adding a Dr Scholl's gel insert. It takes up any excess space, and gives you an extra layer of comfort, in addition to the already supportive Boost pad built into the shoe. For this reason I'd recommend ordering your regular shoe size. As for the sneaker itself, it's lightweight, and comfortable right out of the box. Damn, after all that I feel like either Adidas or Amazon should be paying me for that review, but I promise you they're not. Lol Stop overthinking and go buy yourself some Adidas. The laces don't stretch at all so they feel like they are trying to cut into your shoe and foot when you flex your foot significantly. This makes it so the shoes feel loose most of the time and your foot slides around in, but excessively tight and restrictive if you flex your foot like pushing off from your toes. The top of the inside of these shoes is also unusually lumpy feeling like I have a bunched up sock on my foot. Its not horribly uncomfortable but it feels off. Bottom line: Great shoes for gripping outdoor surfaces once you replace the lacing system with proper shoelaces. I really like the adidas Skychaser boost: they are comfortable, supportive, and look great on feet!. However, through a more consumer-inclined perspective, the minimal boost midsole doesn't provide that unique springy feel that the Energy & Ultra boost models are equipped with!. My guess is, too much of the boost midsole may compromise the lateral/medial aspects supported by the blown EVA cupsole, during off-road trek excursions!. It's very good I like it so much for hiking and riding my mountain bikes Robust trail running shoe that is fairly water resistant. I like the traction of the chunky tread. Provides solid traction.

The shoe is very cushioned but relatively stable. The changes made it less comfortable and less cushioned than the previous models. My arthritic knees felt just fine. I also like the muted colors of the shoe. The gray is perfect for me with the tan logo ok. The shoe fits perfectly. A little snug in the forefoot, but not so much that it creates a hot spot. I highly recommend this shoe for anyone looking for a cushioned, neutral shoe that has good stability. Things I like: Shoe fits true to size. The 12 XW (I have very wide feet) feel very comfortable in the shoe, not tight or loose. They feel great but the DYAD 7 were way more comfortable and provided a lot of motion control. I just needed to break them in and strengthen my foot and leg muscles for non- stability shoes. The old stability DYAD 7 were a solid 8/10. If you have big wide and flat feet like I do, and are a supinator (feet point out/ wear on the outside when running) and are around 210-215lbs I would recommend this. These shoes are also not gonna win any fashion awards but they do look way better than the old man looking DYAD 7. Read more I need an EEEE wide width, Brooks make that size and it fits me well. I also love the extra cushion and neutral gait design of the Dyad, so its a very good shoe for me. The Dyad 7 was the perfect shoe. Dyad 10 is almost as good as the 7. I wish I would have bought multiple pairs of the 7. It looks like an old mans walking shoe. I bought these because they were recommended by several sites as good for people who need arch support. These in fact have adequate arch support and are very comfortable. Brooks executives if you have wide feet chances are youre toes dont magically narrow. 6ft and 260+lbs male looked and found a kind of sneaker years ago that fit, are very comfortable and with good cushioning while providing enough support. Brooks Beast felt like blocks of concrete, the Dyads are at the sweet spot of what I need. There ok but I am not thrilled with the heel fit. The arch support is a little bit higher that the 8's.

I've run 254 miles on them so far and these the Gomeb's are still going strong. Additionally, they are lightweight shoes (I just ran a 16:37 5k in them, I have Achilles issues so I typically don't race in flats unless it's a very serious race and I'm fine being put out for a week). They have holes on the upper mesh that allow for better airflow. One of my favorite pairs of running shoes ever (better than the Saucony Breakthru, Asics gt-1000 and Hoka Clifton 3). Just ran another Boston Marathon qualifier in my Go Meb Razor 2's and now ordered another pair just to make sure I have them available for the future. These shoes are light but give the support I need for marathon runs. Bought these for my father, and he loved them. The fit was perfect. He mentioned how nice and comfortable they are.

Buy a pair for real don't worry if the ""real"" runners don't where them they have no clue!!!. Nice shoe Bought these because of the excellent reviews by running shoe bloggers. I sometimes run a gravel path, and on that path they work really well. They feel natural, dont call attention to themselves, and feel cushioned without being soft. I feel fast in them, and my feet and legs feel fresh afterward. They are also very grippy and surefooted on wet surfaces, when walking. Turns out they dont work very well for me on the road, which is the bulk of my running. They feel a touch flappy, like its difficult to be smooth, and (oddly) seem to encourage striking further towards my heel than usual. They work really well for crossfit and weight training, and thats mostly how I use them."	https://www.amazon.com/Skechers-Mens-Go-MEB-Razor/dp/B074HPVKLW?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B079M8HZYP&psc=1

I am usually not picky about shoes and have run in shoes that are just okay. I feel like they make my feet turn outward. They are definitely not good for running. I would not waste my time on these.

Allows for easy and efficient packing', 'Lightweight mesh and printing techniques are used to eliminate seams and reduce weight.', 'The foot-friendly shape allows toes to spread and splay naturally through your stride', '0-drop, neutral EVA midsole. Carbon Rubber Outsole. Removable footbed.', 'WEIGHT: 6.9 OZ. (SIZE 9)']	"These are my first ever pair of Topos and they did not disappoint. I've been on a mission to find the best minimal, natural style running shoe for the past few months, and my search easily ends here. The shoe is exactly as advertised and impressed me for the following reasons:
- spacious toe box so the toes can splay naturally
- mid foot is locked down securely (without over tightening of the laces)
- the lack of a heel counter didn't play any role in having my heels slip around
- exact amount of cushioning so the the feet can flex naturally in your stride, but not so much where it becomes too responsive
- sock-like comfort and I was able to wear this all day as a walking shoe.
- breathability gets a good grade also

Comments on durability will be noted once more miles are put on these shoes. As of now, I am a happy camper. Not often I put on a new pair of shoes and not notice something wrong with them off the bat. I purchased the ST-2 to compliment my Altra Provision running shoes, and use the ST-2 for tempo faster paced running and to transition to a more minimal running shoe. I like the fit, very light, and secure around ankle. I wear a 10.5 for Nike, Adidas, Altra, and Brooks, ordered a 10.5 for the ST-2 and fit was secure with movement for the toes. The 0mm drop is great along with the low profile. The midsole is more flexible than most shoes. I do wish the outsole on the bottom of the shoe had more durable carbon rubber to extend the life of the shoe, maybe Topo will do this to future models. Overall great shoe. This shoe will be alright for those used to padded zero drop shoes, but for those used to no padding at all it feels like too much. The toes box shape is nice and wide, but the toe box overly tall in size 15, which fit my 14 foot. Also because the bottom is not flat it inhibits feeling the road with your toes. I called Top and this is what they recommended and they were correct. These shoes are extremely comfortable. These shoes were extremely comfortable for me while being on my feet 12 hours a day. So durability is definitely a problem. Pretty disappointing, as I was getting ready to rally behind the Topo brand. I love this shoe. I suffer from multiple knee injuries and I like to lead an active lifestyle. In recent years I have worn ultra cushioning athletic shoes, and I really liked them. Topo is the opposite of these yet they are amazing. They feel like I'm. Super light weight, flexible and roomy in the toe box. Hope this helps. Though I knew right away that I loved these shoes - super light, nice fit, look sharp -- I was a little concerned about the fitting. The heel was snug and the midsole fit well but there was alot of room in the toebox and a full thumb's width distance from the big toe to the end of the shoe. They felt like they might slide around a little on my foot. Though it took that run for me to figure out how best to adapt to the zero rise heel (I am relatively new to minimal road running), I have put another 25 miles on them in the past week and LOVE them. I have found a thicker sock helps for my foot. The extra toe room is perfect and the sole has just the right amount of pad and support to make it comfortable but minimal. These are working great so far. They are very comfortable, light weight, and seem well constructed. While these are only available in a medium width and I generally need wide, I ordered my normal length and they fit surprisingly well with the boxy toe area. I bought these as my primary travel workout shoe, due to the fact that the heel cup easily collapses. Ive been very happy, as they pack flat and provide just enough cushion for quick 2-3 mile runs and hotel gym weightlifting. Whereas other shoes tend to hug the foot, these seem to loosely hold the foot. Quality of the show so far is good. Fit a bit large."	https://www.amazon.com/Topo-Athletic-ST-2-Running-Shoes/dp/B01FG8K0YG?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01FG8J06A&psc=1

The soles on this shoes seems to be much tougher so hopefully they will have a longer life than the speedcross. Fit is good, toe box is wider than many shoes, which I prefer for comfort. They seem like they will be great for warm weather as the air cuts right through them. These fit slightly narrower than other Solomons Ive had, but still fit great. These have been awesome for my 11 year old who is really hard on shoes. So far they haven't even begun to break down like other shoes. I love the quality of the Salomon brand. I have a narrow foot and have been wearing Solomon trail runners for years because they fit my foot well and are extremely comfortable. Otherwise very pleased with it. Love Salomon shoes, these were a bit small for the size ordered run a little small, good shoe, great price around $40. I just switched shoe brand for the first time in years and I am absolutely thrilled with my decision. I am loving this shoe. I love these sneakers.

I have always enjoyed the gel cushioning system and that continues on with these. The reason the shoes dont get a 5 star rating is because while theyre a knit shoe, they dont breathe as well as others on the market. These are comparable with the Adidas Ultra Boost... however, the ultra boost is superior in every way. For the price, theyre worth it. As an everyday training shoe, theyre fantastic. Good price and they look great. The only shoe I have given 5-stars is the ultra boost. Received as indicated and as promised. Fits fairly excellent, although snug fit, due to the high instep, took some time to get the hang of wearing and putting on. But, once on, it is an excellent comfort and support. Toes frayed easily. Cheap stuff, looks like the toes hit a cheese grater after 1 use. I wear these to work every single day and i bought another pair to use for working out, they are the most comfortable breathable shoe i've ever had, very happy with my purchase. Love these.

692	2	Under Armour Speedform Fortis 2	['Mesh', 'Imported', 'EVA|RUBBER sole', 'sku=1273942-001-9']	"For those of us who loved the original Fortis, this one is a huge downgrade. UA rep claimed it breathed better but nothing was changed structurally -- WRONG. The uppers are much stiffer -- eliminating the elastic sock-like fit of the original Fortis. My advice to UA: stop trying to be like Nike, changing models every year whether they need it or not. I've ordered another pair of the original Fortis, and am hoping they stay on the market. These shoes are attractive and have good support. They also fit well and are comfortable UNTIL YOU START RUNNING. The back of these shoes rubbed the skin on my Achilles so horribly that I ended up bleeding through my athletic socks after about 3 miles. They're great if you have an endless supply of tape and you don't mine blisters. These show up, and thinking they would be fine, I threw the box out. Well, guess what -- they'r'e made 1/2 size too small. The shoes themselves are made VERY well, are very light, and other than being too small, are great feeling. I order a size 12 and the length didn't it but the sides were perfect. Length was perfect, but sides a little too wide. Tops of the out heal slightly rubbed against my ankle, but seems to get better after a couple weeks of break in. Got them for running and they have good support and are light weight. The fit was as if it came from a college kid at Footlocker. I am very happy with the quality of the foot Ware bought here

More like a trail shoe with higher ankles. Like all inov8s Ive owned, they are very snug to fit. They feel great out of the box, but really a glorified trail shoe not a hiking boot. UPDATE: Holding up well, feel good. Run a bit warm. We were them on some hardcore trails in Costa Rica and we were very satisfied. The grip was excellent in all conditions, and the mud fell out of the tread nicely. Another great shoe from an awesome company. They feel much better. So far so good. Great alternative if you do not want to wear a boot. Very soft and flexible, for people that prefer hiking in running shoes. I ordered 12.5 and they fit perfect. These are really nice, light, comfortable shoes. Very happy with my purchase....and like the fact that no one else is wearing these. Light, secure footing. Fits like a glove for precise control. Trial running on off-camber gnarly trails is great with these shoes. The secure fit and control of a boot with the speed of a running shoe. The perfect lightweight backpacking shoe for me. I usually take an 11 and this 11 fit fine. They are superb, Perfect fit. Laces lock in for great ankle support. Nice looking too. Awesome boot for early season archery.

On the other hand, the left shoe seems fine and I do notice improved mid-foot cushioning which is what I was looking for. Very comfortable shoes - very plush. My previous Saucony Hurricanes (the Hurricane 16) were a size 10.5W. Amazon recommended that I order a size 11, which I did. (11W) They fit pretty well, so I can only assume that China keeps making them smaller and smaller for a given size. One day I expect I'll wear size 16s and can then join the NBA, make millions, and retire comfortably at age 60... I really like these shoes, I always have issue trying to find shoes that are 2E wide, and I need shoes that help with moderate pronation, so finding shoes that have a wide 2E are very limited by companies, but these shoes are really really comfortable. These shoes have Plush Cusion inside to help with impact when running or exercising. I purchased another pair of these shoes as they were a really great price from amazon. I recommend these shoes if you are looking for stability shoes, I also love the green color.

5 stars!. These are great, but I think they run a little smaller than the predecessors. These are a very comfortable shoe. Great shoe for someone with flat or somewhat flat feet. To date these are my favorite. While these didnt have as much of a cushiony feel as another pair, these seemed to give better support. After more than a year, I would say that they were a good purchase; I have purchased more. I purchase these even though Saucony is on to the ISO 4 because they are still great running shoes, in style, and can be found for a fraction of the next iteration. Fit, comfort, stability, everything is great. I have been running in the Hurricanes for years on end and have rarely been disappointed. These lace up even better than previous versions and the ankle collar and tongue are all improved over last version."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Hurricane-Running-Shoe/dp/B01MU3A1NB?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01HYJBZGM&psc=1

Excellent comfort level, with solid support and and great cushioning. Size: they seem to run about a half size large, so I ordered an 11.5 based on other reviews (I usually wear 12), and they fit perfectly. I wasn't much of an Adidas guy previously, but they're winning me over. This design is great, and I'm impressed with the small details. Even the laces are high-end, better than expected. These shoes are the kind with the ""captive"" tongue, meaning it's sewn in on both sides, all the way up to the top of the shoe, kind of like a built-in elastic sock. And although the shoe itself fits fine, the ""sock"" part is tight across the top of my foot, making the whole shoe feel tight. You could run in these neutral running shoes, but I use them for casual Friday at work. Love the shoes so much that I purchased three pairs in different colors. I've tried this model for running and it's just OK, but nothing comparable to other neutral running shoes such as Brooks Beast, Brooks Glycerin, Asics Nimbus, etc... The shoes are understated and don't scream: ""I'm a running shoe that glows neon in the dark- look at me, look at me."" They cradle the foot and make your feet feel protected as opposed to the Adidas Alphabounce Ems which are wider, less stable and almost too wide. The cushioning here is outstanding. The manufacturer removable inserts work fine. My favorite color is the blue because they go with blue jeans well. Black is the second favorite and gray is the least favorite because the ""gray"" looks almost white and you can see the upper pattern design more which, well, makes this look less like a casual Friday shoe. This is my 2nd pair and I love the look of this shoe the fit was exactly like all of my previous Adidas shoes I have purchased. These shoes are great for any type of use I'll be using these more for dress and not athletic use. I highly suggest these for comfort and great looks. Pretty good feel in the shoe, basically everything you would expect from alphabounce. Now it's like slightly loose. I love these shoes, they are so comfortable and they don't squeak on slippery floors. they absorb a lot of shock. I have adidas springblades as well and these are much better in my opinion. the springblades are always getting rocks and mud stuck in them and I don't want to drive in those for fear of the blades hooking onto the gas/brake pedals. these, however, are just a great all around shoe. They fit snug more so across the laces. I usually don't buy running shoes this expensive but now I'm glad I did."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01I0D6HA0/ref=asc_df_B01I0D6HA01555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01I0D6HA0&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Gaiter compatible (gaiter sold s']	Just received the shoes today and I'll be back in a month to provide an update after I have a chance to break them in. Right now I'd like to say that the shoe fits as advertised and what I've learned over the years is that if a shoe fits small, most often is due to the toe box, this pair I purchased because it was advertised with a larger toe box and that's exactly what works best for me - I'm a size 13 and jumping to a 14 to accommodate the manufacture is dumb because the large size always ends up with a sloppy heel or too much slippage and as a runner of single tracks, the show must fit just right and this pair does it. If you are purchasing this shoe for walking, already I can say you'll find these shoes to be very comfortable. I'm a big fan of Inov-8 shoes	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075TFG45G/ref=asc_df_B075TFG45G1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B075TFG45G&linkCode=asn&psc=1

I purchased these to include in my shoe rotation as I work out every day and found it best to rotate footwear to reduce the effect of repetitive movements found in most cardio exercise. These Saucony Nomad TR Runners are comfortable right out of the box and I noticed no break-in time in order to get the most out of them. The toe is more box shaped than tapered, and this helps greatly with toe spread during running. Overall, I am VERY satisfied with these Sauconys. GREAT SHOE! I love Sauconys and these meet all of my expectations. I've purchased Saucony off and on for years, with great experiences with all my purchases. Here are several initial impressions I've made while running in them today:

1. These are not, in my opinion, worthy of being used as a dedicated trail shoe. Over the course of my entire run, these only excelled during the cross country and walking trail portions. These simply are absolutely NOT going to cut it for anyone that runs advanced trails.

2. They have a very awkward fit. I purchased the correct size and the size that I've always worn in Saucony and these fit very oddly. The fit almost seems to want me to wear these without socks. Either way, they're definitely a bit narrow and a bit small in all areas. While I think these are nonsense for advanced trails, I think they'd be perfect for regular running. They are very comfortable, have a nice fit once on, have some nice touches material wise and feel good overall. As that, these are good. In short:

If you just want to run in these on the road or cross country paths, they're fine but consider moving up a half size if you're on the tail end of your size. On the other hand, if you're buying these as your go to trail runner, I can't in good conscious recommend these. Please really consider how you intend to use these and follow the above. Cheers. These are the first pair of shoes I have purchased off of Amazon, so I bought these pretty much sight unseen. After using the Nomad TR shoes for over a year, they have held up very well; outside of work (and yard work), these are the shoes I reach for 90% of the time. To a point, they still feel like they are breaking in. The sole design is a bit unusual, but it doesn't trap dirt very well, which is a big plus. Pros:
Light weight (shoe has one-piece upper)
Holds up well (depending on usage**)
Distinctive appearance

Cons:
Slim to size (I went up a half-size and it still fits like a glove)
Distinctive appearance (for those who consider that an issue)

While I'm not currently in the market for shoes right now, if I were to replace these, another pair of Saucony shoes would be under consideration. Read more Built on the popular Kinvara platform this shoe has a lot to live up to, and largely delivers. I bought this shoe to serve as my winter, trail, and general bad weather trainer; with good grip, good comfort, and a grippy outsole, this shoe delivers nicely. The Nomad's upper is nicely constructed and very warm; the weather resistant ""jacket"" does, however, come at a cost; the shoe does not breathe or vent well. My feet were very warm and sweaty after a 12-mile run. That warmth will be a blessing as the temps start to drop. The design works, and provides excellent grip on wet grass, mud, dirt and gravel. Flex is excellent for a trail shoe, and response is also good. The shoe is snug (which I like) on the forefoot and captured my heel nicely; I could have done with a little more arch support by the end of the 12-miler, but without an aftermarket or custom insole, that's pretty common for my feet. Fit was right where I expected it.

This is a great shoe. I just took them out on a 9 mile trail run, out of the box, and they performed very well. The shoes provide good support and traction. I recommend them for light to medium trails. The La Sportiva Wildcat is between the Brooks Ghost GTX and the Salomon XA Prod 3D GTX in ruggedness and will be great for my daily runs through the woods. If they err on one side, I like it to be on the side of comfort and light weight. These shoes are fantastic. I run trails in South Mountain park in Phoenix AZ, run on the golf course near my home, and play golf a few times a week. These shoes excel in all three environments. Additionally, before i wore my first pair of La Sportiva shoes on the rocky trails in Phoenix, i always needed to pull an extra pair of inner soles in my hiking boots, and still returned home on many days with what felt like a weird massage at the bottom of my feet. Great shoe. I never thought I'd pay this much for a running shoe again, but I owned a prior version I bought on sale and liked them so much I wanted another pair when the others wore out. They are waterproof, the soles are sticky, and the tread grips incredibly well. The lacing pattern seems overly complicated Good, comfortable shoe however sizing is smaller than we typically experience. I ultimately purchased one size larger than my normal size and I think it is going to work great. Tread wore well and generally the grip was excellent. Best part, not one blister. I have arch pain from supination (walking on outside of foot with fairly high arches) these are best shoes I've found so far for daily 3-5 mile walks. Tried many shoes and supports - these are great right out of box and waterproofing very good too. La Sportiva's shoes just fit my feet for some reason, their last must look familiar. I've only had two pairs of their shoes, so my review is not extensive, but so far I've found their shoes to be technically brilliant. Not very light, but a decent amount of motion control and lots of padding, great traction. My feet are pretty narrow and I had to get a half size larger than usual.

Didn't anyone try them on before putting them on the market. Putting these shoes on is like stuffing your foot into a bicycle innertube, it bunches your socks up so that when you do accomplish getting your foot inside, your bunched up socks hurt your toes. I love the ""belt buckle"" idea for the tongue. I took several walks and short runs and these are quite comfortable. Very soft on my runs and very little shock, great soles. Great for my knees. Love the color too. When I'm actually walking or running in them though, they feel fine. They look great as well. Really liked the shoes, nice and sleek and felt comfortable but just too small. Definitely order a size up if you decide to go with these Nice idea, did not like the sock like fit. I have a narrow foot and these are fine on the foot but overall tight especially over instep. Received as indicated and as promised. Fits fairly excellent, although snug fit, due to the high instep, took some time to get the hang of wearing and putting on.

I really don't understand why shoes are made with narrow pointy toe boxes at all; it simply doesn't make sense when it comes to anatomy and comfort. They have better color schemes, better overall looks, better tread (Altra keep putting less and less tread on many of their road shoes and I hate it. I can absolutely tell the difference in grip on the road), better cushion, and the model options that come with a small heel-to-toe differential for those that want it - although I am used to the zero-drop. On top of that, Topo's sizing seems to be consistent across their different models of shoe. I ordered their Terraventure as well in the same size and they fit the same. Anyway, great shoe, will be staying with this brand
Read more I like the Topo brand and the toe box. I'm used to wearing zero drop running shoes with wider toe boxes so Topo was a natural choice.

723	3	Salming Trail 5	['Synthetic-and-mesh']	I tested these Salming5s, as well as La Sportiva and Scott models. The Salming5s demonstrate excellent protection, a fit that is comfortable but fully adequate to allow aggressive descents over rocks and roots on long, steep downhills, good cushion and a nicely proportioned toe box that allows ample room across the metatarsal heads and for the toes to splay. I ran a 50K over 9700' vertical gain with only about 10 miles on the shoes--they performed perfectly. I compare the Trail5 to another favorite trail shoe for me, the Saucony Peregrine 6 and 7. The Salmings have an arguably less aggressive tread, and superior protection, with a little more room in the toe box. While not quite as bomb proof as the La Sportiva Ultra Raptors (what is?), the Salmings went hard over some of the roughest terrain on any trail race in the US (Franklin Mountains, El Paso,TX), and steep downhills over rocks without injury to toes, instep, or soles of feet, at times kicking rocks and catching roots at full strides. The Vibram soles are grippy, and along with the rock shields, protect the soles of the feet. While the Timps are a great light trail shoe at this point, and provide excellent cushioning for ultra distances, over the punishing terrain of the Franklins as well as other rocky trail with vertical features like that found in the Texas Hill Country (Hill Country State Park, Flat Rock Ranch for example), I was less foot sore after 33 miles in the Salming5s than 26 miles in the Timps after a trail marathon at Flat Rock Ranch and another 26 mikes of training at the Franklins. I find the Trail5s run true to size, but did purchase a pair a half size up to have for distances over 50K to accommodate foot swelling. The half size is notably more roomy, particularly in the toe box, while overall fit remains good.

The shoes are good for about 2 months of running and then another 3-4 months of work and play duty. I have ran many races in ASIC and my favorites are the Cumulus. With that said these were awesome. Fit great and I have already used them in workouts a few times. Very soft feel, great support, and they look great. Read more These shoes seems to loose support after about 20minutes. I found the ideal environment for these shoes, is walking around on the living rug. Read more Most comfortable shoes Ive had as long as I can remember. Bought the size shoe I wear (13) and they fit perfect right out of the box. They look great as well. Read more I think this may be the best ASICS shoes Ive ever bought Its actually wide enough for my foot and extremely comfortable

They're solid any day shoes with that flyknit feel that you won't feel bad about scuffing like your limited edition lunar epics. I bicycle commute to work 4 days a week and I wear these more often than not: they're holding up admirably but with an EVA sole it might not last as long on the daily grind like a rubber sole will so keep that in mind. Fit: I'm a true 10 and the size 10's were perfect. I also have wider feet but even then because of the knit material it doesn't feel constricting and is otherwise comfortably snug. I've had em for a little under a month and they're doing alright with daily wear, but only time will tell when or if it'll give out. For the price I paid however, I'm not disappointed.

These are far more comfortable than any hiking boot I have tried. I took them on my trek to Kilimanjaro and was hesitant but extremely happy. My feet never had a problem day after day on the mountain. The Salomons have a lot more support and I was afraid I would need it on more rocky technical areas. Im happy to report I never switched from the Altras. I just couldnt give up the comfortable toe box. And the support was sufficient although once or twice a rock would hit the upper side of my foot and these dont provide protection for that. They are like heavy duty running shoes. Ill also put my keens or Merrills in the same boat firing well with middle of the road support. The Altras are just way lighter an way more comfortable than all of them. And yes lighter on support. I also liked that I could wear them in 60-70 weather and I also got them down to 5 degrees with good socks and was not cold. It ma the comfort. You will walk longer hike further if your feet deal good. I also think they look good. Buy them you will love them as I do. The paradigm 4.0 was my first Altra and it's ventilated front was fantastic in the dry Summer. Going into the rainy season I needed something more water resistant and the shoe is definitely it. This shoe is warmer in 30-40F weather than I thought it would be but I don't know how it will handle the -10F winters we get here. I use these as a work shoes and they've held up nicely there as well. All around a great fit and exactly what I'd expect for my shoe size. Keep them coming Altra! - and if you drop a Gore-Tex shoe you'll probably have another purchase from me :)
Read more To start with, the vendor. I needed one return/exchange to get the right shoe and the vendor, Outdoor Equipped, was fantastic. Army boots (70s edition, pretty basic and comfortable runners), hiking boots, five fingers, trail gloves, many more. Ive been pretty much minimalist/zero drop for 10 years with some exceptions. All that said, after a week on wet and soggy Gettysburg Battlefield trails, woods, and open fields (Picketts Charge), these are simply the best shoes I have ever had on my feet. Plenty of protection yet a minimalist feel and fantastic ground control on bare ground, asphalt, and mudruns. I trot/walk/sprint with sticks and add lots of zigzags, like ground skiing, these shoes are perfect. Very waterproof (roughly ankle deep) and extremely breathable. :-)
First track update: a lovely three-four inches of snow for Picketts Charge gave these shoes a two-mile caked in snow with occasional stops test for warmth, waterproofing, and breathability. Easy. Love the zero drop and wide forefoot design. Very natural. High top trail running shoes are a truly great concept. Hardly adds any weight and it protects the ankle from both scrapes and twisting. Way better than regular hiking boots because you have better mobility, natural movement, and light weight. Amount of padding and protection on the bottom is perfect for rocky trails. Plenty of protection but not too much to interfere with natural movement of the foot. Better than the previous 3.0 design which ended up splitting at the instep. They beefed this area up a bit with additional rubber which also protects a bit more against abrasions. But as I said, this is improved. Nonetheless, I'm careful where I step so that I don't get nasty rock abrasions against the side of the shoe. This is an amazing combo. Why aren't there more designs like this"	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Waterproof-Trail-Running/dp/B079RJFKK5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07GZVTGZX&psc=1

The wider toebox and flatter sole is a big improvement for people with normal width feet who want to run on the balls of their feet and not have their toes scrunched up. Still it is better than a lot of other shoes for me. So far the tread design seems very good, comfortable, and reasonably durable. Overall weight is nice and light. Time will tell on the durability of the upper (it seems lightly built), but for casual road running it ought to last long enough for most people. For me it is stretched out tight around my forefoot and will probably wear pretty quick. The first thing that impressed me was how light and roomy (around toes) they were in comparison to my other running shoes. It really feels like you are running on a soft surface the whole time. Read more I absolutely Love this brand shoe. It works perfectly for my toes/feet. Read more Great for someone with narrow-ish heels - yet needed wide toe room. Because I have narrow heels, most shoes that fit me there really pinch my toes. The Altras are natural - they really give the room. Getting a lot of miles on these and holding up well.

However, I will say it's important to get the right fit and to do so I went to the New Balance store for the first pair and, for me, that also required an insert.

Read more First off, this is an awesome shoe for comfort and fit. I've always worn Nikes and tried this shoe and I love it. My UAs are now my favorite shoes due to comfort and fit.

737	17	Under Armour SpeedForm Slingshot	['Synthetic-and-mesh']	I bought these shoes because I like Under Armour, as well the color and design of this particular pair. This is my second time ordering UA shoes online, and even though the orders were of two different models they both fit perfectly, which tells me that UA is doing something right in regards to the continuity of their sizing across shoe models. These shoes look great and feel great, and what's truly remarkable is that there hasn't even been a breaking-in period where your feet would typically hurt, these just felt great right out of the box. I plan to use these shoes for normal, daily activity, and so far they've been perfect. This running shoe is probably the best shoe I've had in a decade. Very strong support, and the mesh at the toe gives so much comfort that you won't realize you're into your 3rd mile until it's too late to stop... I have a new respect for UA running... Read more Great running shoe. I really like the fit, and the lightness. Plus, I liked that laces adjust around the foot. They would tightly fit my feet while the material flexed without being too tight and no seems. I am very happy with this purchase. Read more I recently replaced all my running shoes with a couple different brands, which included 3 pairs of UA. This pair (love the blue) is by far the most comfortable (and expensive). The tongue isn't something I've ever seen...there's an opening only on the outer side of the shoe & the inner side looks like a slip-on shoe. It looks weird, but it prevents the tongue from sliding left/right and I kinda like it. I wouldn't want all my shoes like this, but it's creative. I'd like a few more in different colors, but not at $120 a pair. Read more I used to run in the saucony A6, have been searching for a good replacement since Saucony discontinued their racing flat. It's light, comfortable - great arch support. Read more Its hard to say whether this is a true running shoe or not, but its bloody close. For me, I would have to say this is a great cross training shoe. If your looking for something that is flexible, sturdy, and a very good construction, this shoe will fit perfectly. Read more I know that U.A. men's athletic shoes fit a little small. Thus, I can say that the fit is as expected because I already was aware of their sizing. I love them.

740	20	Asics GT 2000 5 Lite-Show	['Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Shaft measures approximately low-top from arch', 'Fluid Ride Midsole', 'Heel Clutching System']	"These are the first GT-2000s I've tried, and they are amazing. Firm like Kayanos and supportive, I think they have a little more height and cushion than the current Kayanos, a feature that is better for me as a 185lb slight heel striker with a neutral gait tending toward pronation. As expected they were super comfy right out of the box. This pair seemed to fit well and I started walking in them and did a limited amount of running. Read more I bought this shoe at this same time last year (Dec 30, 2017 to be exact) for a fair enough price of $74.95. They have been very comfortable and lasted a reasonable amount of time considering the stress I put them through, given my size (6'/210lbs) and usage of them (work 8-10hrs/day on feet). However, I went back to an old pair of GT 2000 4s that these were a replacement for because they now feel more like a cheap pair of Chucks (Converse) than a premium running shoe. The toe mesh has begun tearing as well, but as I said, I beat them up pretty good daily. I will note that this was not a problem with the previous models. I realize this is more rant than review, but both Asics and Verified Products are unscrupulous at best. Who cares as long as they sell more units. I'm sure Asics can ride on its previous reputation for years to come, and looking at the seller's page you'll see nothing but exemplary reviews. Perhaps I'm alone in my way of thinking and being honorable means nothing beyond earning bumper stickers for your parents' minivans as a youth. It's made of a slick/slippery feeling material that makes the shoe and tongue slide around a lot more on my foot than any other material I've had on my many other GT-2000's. They're fine for that. Read more Looks great and comfortable but doesn't fit. they are over a 1/4"" narrower than my last pair. Read more Good every day running shoe. If I need a break and want extra cushion Ill switch to the gel nimbus for a day or so,, which is my other shoe. The GT 2000 sole wears longer, I can almost get 200 miles out of them. Overall a solid trainer for the bulk of runs. Youll want a lighter shoe for speed work. This is my first pair of the ""5"" and it feels like it's taking longer than normal to break them in. Fit is the same as it's ever been.

741	21	Altra Instinct 4.0	['100% Quick-Dry Air Mesh', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'All New Upper Design', 'Full Rubber Outsole', 'EVA with A-Bound Top Layer and InnerFlex Midsole']	"Altra's original Instinct was a great shoe for me: a zero drop, ""minimalist"" shoe with a wide rounded toe box that fit my wide forefoot of toes that do not come to a point. Excitement prevailed when Altra announced they would use the original lasts on the Instinct 4. Unfortunately, the same size Instinct 4 has a narrower and shorter fit than the original Instinct. This rubber has no give like the original Instinct fabric and leather upper, and tapers down to the front edges effectively reducing the inside area where my toes need it the most. The Instinct 4 has a lot of sideways rocking (probably designed to roll the foot with a heel-strike) whereas the original Instinct sits flat except for a slight roll-up in the front (great for my mid-foot strike gait). Altra, please bring back the original Instinct. Read more I love the fit and feel.I had a pair of Instinct 3.5 that I wore to tatters. These new 4s fit just the same as the 3.5 for size. Oddly, the solid black laces are a bit shorter. They are very comfortable to me. The black design is more black (no swirly design) and seems more well made than the 3.5. Another note, the tongue is actually a tiny bit shorter, though this does not matter for the fit or comfort at all. Thank you AGAIN Altra. The instinct is the only minimslist shoe I've found that fits me well. I've owned the 3.0 and liked it. I contacted Altra and gave them feedback, even offered to work with them testing out future revisions to the Instinct (was getting 50-70miles of hiking in wooded areas at the time, so thought it a worthy offer). When the 4.0 came out I had mixed enthusiasm when thinking about ordering due to the fumble of the 3.5, but it looked improved so I ordered. I'm Glad I did. It's the best Instinct so far. They last longer and are easier to clean mud off due to improved design. Better grip. Better footstrike. Laces tighten and secure better. I could go on reharding the improvements made but to surmise I'd be fine if they continued the Instinct line without any additional revisions, fcousin on increasing quality and reducing cost. However, due to the good work they're done getting the Instinct to this point I'm optimistic the next revision will also be a winner. I'm still hoping they'll make an addition to the Instinct sizing especially for wide feet. It fots, better than anything else, but I get the impression that while it accomodate extra wide feet it is designed and optimized for the average width foot. It would be nice to know what that feels like, but, really it's hard to list that as a con when these shoes work far better than the competing offerings. After about 1 mile, my legs would warm up enough that I could get a decent stride in. I was relieved when I came back home and used a different pair of shoes that my feet felt fine. I don't know what happened with these shoes in particular, as I have owned several pairs of Altra's and they have been fine. It used to be my favorite brand of shoes"	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Instinct-Running-Shoe/dp/B01HNL6K0W?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01ICAQW60&psc=1

Update
I got home almost limping because those shoes hurt my skin too much These are a little difficult to get on but once on are very form fitting to the foot and very comfortable. Very comfortable good looking shoes once you get them on. Maybe time will teach me how to better get them on. I have been very happy with these shoes. They are very comfortable and slip on very quick and easy. They seem to be holding up quite well. I sometimes work 14 hour days and my feet aren't killing me. Wear these every day at work and its been 6 months and have minimal wear and still really comfortable. I love that they have no shoe laces and just bungee kind of laces for easy on and off I got these as a gift for someone very picky about foot wear and they love them. They look nice, and have held up incredibly well. He raves about how comfortable they are.

746	26	On Cloudventure Peak	['mesh', 'Rubber sole', 'multi-colored', 'round-toe', 'cushioning']	Fantastic shoes, extremely comfortable. Primarily use these for walking and trail running, there's not a lot of bounce in these shoes, but that doesn't seem to bother me too much on the trail. This is a very comfortable walking shoe. The shoe also feels like it has a rounded bottom, forcing you heal strike rather the forefoot strike...so great for heal strikers and bad for forefoot strikers. They seem to bottom out when you run and unless you have a very very fast cadence, they don't seem as springy as my Boost shoes. My bounce experience holds true for both. As well, they don't appear to use the same last for each line, so if you're a 9 in one, you could be a 9.5 or more in another. They're great for that. They just hug, hold, and bounce much much better than these. I think Ons are the best looking walkers I own. I even wash them to keep them looking nice. This shoe is firm but comfortable and holds the foot well. I was quickly through the fabric and soon well down into the foam padding. These shoes even wore through where the top of the back hit my Achilles tendon. Serious shortcoming in an otherwise great shoe.	https://www.amazon.com/-Running-Mens-Cloudventure-Peak-Running/dp/B01HOF2P9W?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B06Y5LCXNG&psc=1

Previous UA running shoes I owned in the past were okay but either the cushioning would break down too soon or they were light but lacked stability. Even after 60 days, the cushioning seems to feel as good as when I first bought them. I think UA's Charged cushioning is better than their Micro G foam midsoles. I'm very glad I ordered this shoe to replace my worn out Asics Kayano 20s. Gorgeous shoe, well designed and very comfortable, however, it run s small. The design and colors are very attractive and the arch support is great. Recommend anyone that orders this model goes up one size, especially for running. Love the fit, color and most importantly the foot support. Fantastic shoe. Under Armour makes great shoes, just not this one.

When I first got a pair of Kinvara 5's, I thought the added plushness to the tongue and around the ankle would bother me as I really liked the simplicity of the previous versions. Once I started running in them, that turned out to not be a problem at all and the slightly added room in the toe box solved the only minor gripe had with the 2's, 3's and 4's. Less flexible too, but that might just be because they're brand new. I even tried ordering a 2nd pair in a half size up but while they were a little better, there was a tightness that seemed to be there by design. I'll try again if a 7th edition come out but this as far as I want to experiment with the current version. I was pleasantly surprised. The toe box, the main reason I buy Saucony, was ever so slightly more narrow but not uncomfortably so. And they admit it. My favorite model in that time was the 3. I loved the 3 because it was like a slipper with cushioning - not so much a heel ""cup"" as a heel ""pad"", and no extra material anywhere, but enough protection to last pretty near the full duration of a marathon. This one is like the 5, just a light version of the battleship running shoes that have dominated the market since the 1970s except for the brief flurry of minimalist activity that originally launched the Kinvara. Running shoes always ""run small"", which is to say that anybody who runs knows that your running shoes need to be a good size bigger than regular shoes - so that's the baseline for ""fits as expected"", one size bigger than other shoes. I always bought all my Saucony running shoes in 11.5, and my newest pair of Peregrine 4s fit fabulously as 11.5; but with the Kinvara 5 and 6, I find that the 11.5 causes my big toe to push against the top, and my second toe to push against the front. So I'd recommend going up a half size even from other running shoes. Despite all these gripes I give the shoe 4 stars because it's a very light shoe that costs very little, that I can cycle through six or so pairs a year without breaking my budget, and that can comfortably carry me through the finish line of a marathon either racing or pacing, and can still be used for a 5k or even (in a pinch) a mile race on the track. I just wish running shoe companies didn't continuously screw with the products - release a shoe and leave it alone for five or ten years please. Transitioning from a 10mm heel drop to 4mm heel drop took a couple of runs, but the fit is just perfect. I've heard much fuss about the pro-lock feature, but you can hardly make out its presence while running, and the midfoot fit is snug, so it is doing what it is supposed to do. I would have loved some subdued color options, but it is what it is. I do miss the cushion of the Z-pump, but this is sole is padded enough and it is easier to cover longer distances. Deserves a 4.5 star rating, but giving it a 4 since there is no option. I ran in the Kinvara 5's and they were one of the best shoes I have worn. Saucony ruined a great shoe for me"	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Kinvara-Running-Shoe/dp/B00PJ870QU?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00RK34LGO&psc=1

I bought these for my new job where I'm walking around and standing all day. I use these shoes for step and other exercise classes and they are very light but supportive. It has been years since I bought a Reebok shoe but they always seem to have good products. They are fantastic for that. So comfortable I took them on a walking vacation to Washington DC and New York city where we walked an average of 10 miles plus a day. With these my feet did not hurt at the end of the day. Really like them. The shoe did last about 7 months, but I was hoping for more. The color was amazing; they really popped and I hoped I could have kept them. Overall I like the shoe but I did not realize the top is just a mesh material so in cold weather it does very little to keep your feet warm. A good running shoe but don't expect it to keep your feet warm. Comfortable, good traction, light weight, memory foam insole feels great	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N9HB622/ref=asc_df_B01N9HB6221555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01N9HB622&linkCode=asn&psc=1

However, the build appears to be great and the shoe lace system is pretty fancy (never had a she lace system like this). I am going to keep the shoe and hope they stretch (width) a little. I still gave the shoe 4 stars as the construction and quality appear good and it appears Salomon's run a little small from what I read. Honestly, I can not tell the difference. The M+ shoe has number 392644 where the regular has 3982514. The style is quite nice and I like the quick lace system. Overall it is a great shoe, just a tad too narrow. If the shoe was wider (or my feet were more narrow), I might love them. These are great. These are perfect for the trail, but the tread will wear down fast on concrete/asphalt. Also, the shock absorption on these is minimal- which is supportive on trails, etc (what these are designed for), but again not suited for hard ground all day. Update after 11 months of regular use- these are the absolute best all-around shoes Ive ever owned. They have held up remarkably well. I really hope they continue to expand their options in wide sizes. Toe box is wide and feels great. I have narrow feet and my 13 m+ fit perfect. Overall these shoes feel very stable, very comfortable for walking and running. Very comfortable and breathable shoe. The breathability is especially a plus if I get caught out on a rainy day; shoes dry out well overnight in a well ventilated area. I haven't done any backpacking in these yet, however they certainly feel great for fun day hikes like Mailbox Peak, WA. Also pretty comfortable when walking around for long periods in general. LOVE the wider fit. Very good for autumn and winter time. It looks much better than most of salmon shoes, gives a great arch and is relatively light weight. My last pair of Salomon trail running shoes was the best I had ever had. Great shoes, I have gone though a few pairs, after constant every day use. Great for the trail too. The kevlar strap makes them easy to put on and take off rapidly.	https://www.amazon.com/Salomon-Mens-Pro-Trail-Runner/dp/B01HD6S410?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01J3Z0QP6&psc=1

The Flyknit and flywire tech are an upgrade and definitely worth What they do for comfort and performance. I bought this Flyknit Racer shoes for my friends birthday. When my friend opened it up and put it on, he felt there was a noticeable size difference in each shoe even though the label indicates it is the same size. These are one of my favorite running shoe models and this is my second pair. I have to be honest that I never would have lookednat Nikes otherwise. I have a neuroma in my foot that requires a wide forefoot in a shoe and/or flexible fabric. The Flyknit on these is perfect for what I need. I wore these straight out of the box for the Boston Marathon after realizing my original pair were past their prime after running 2 marathons in them. Great cushioning and support. A very light, comfortable running shoe that conforms to the shape of your foot and looks great. These slip on and off like slippers, but still have a somewhat decent amount of support. They're a tad snug for my liking though. Not too snug for me to return them, but snug enough that I wish I'd ordered a half-size up. Overall, a very good pair of running shoes. Fit - these LOOK small,BUT are not. Once you get about 10 miles walking/running in these they are broken in and will fit TRUE TO SIZE.
Quality - my expectation of this shoe are limited. the foam is so light i expect it to wear out after a year or so. some running, but mostly casual user. the flyknit is on the thinner side so i could see a snag or wear and tear in certain spots happening. but until this happens, these are great. Looks - best looking running shoe out there. Comfort - better comfort than any shoe i use. this includes asics, brooks, under armour fortis 3, and puma carson. Recommendation - buy it. expensive, yes, but worth the comfort and style. I've owned dozens of Nike's and usually they are great. First of all, the fit is narrow and tight. It gets a little better once you break them in, but not much. They work great if you are just running in a straight line, but nothing else really. Other than that, the cushioning on the bottom of the shoe is great, and they really do look good, but I wouldn't buy these again. Very nice shoe. I would recommend a half to a size bigger. Would be fine for longer runs as well but I pronate a little often use a stability shoe as well. I like to change shoes every other run and this shoe is great in the rotation. Has a bigger heal drop and lots of cushioning so is easy on the heel and knees. Really comfortable to wear all day. Color and comfort = good, for working out = bad
Nike is by far the best fit for my feet. They are very comfortable, but offer very little support for either running to moderate agility (side-to-side) exercises in the gym."	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MEDB1CP/ref=asc_df_B01MEDB1CP1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01MEDB1CP&linkCode=asn&psc=1

I'm generally pretty cheap when choosing shoes, like $40 is a lot, but these might have changed my mind. Definitely the most comfortable shoes I think I've ever had, and I'll definitely consider Merrells again in the future. Very light weight and comfortable. Great product.

Bottom line, I called Xero before ordering these. Yes, I've read the bazillion comments on being too small, but I wear a size 14. And if, like me, you have legitimate size 14 feet, you are pretty much out of luck for minimalist trail shoes as most vendors don't make, or rarely stock, size 14+. Anyway, I left a message on Friday afternoon after work hours, and I got a call back on Sunday suggesting I purchase through Amazon for the free returns. Five bucks more, but that's great customer service!!. Shoes arrived as promised, and as (sadly) expected, the largest size made, the 14's, aren't anywhere CLOSE to fitting a size 14 foot. Too bad, I've enjoyed my Xero huaraches, but please, fix the sizing and help us big dudes out!!. I bought 3 different pairs in the Men's sizes because I require wide fit shoes... The 8 fits great and I wore them to work where I am on my feet all day and loved them, can't wait to try them out on the trail!. LOVE LOVE that Amazon has free shipping and free returns.. that helped. First day I loved them for comfort style and warmth. The tread is great but its already separating from the shoe, which looks like ive been kickboxing with Shredder in his razor armor. Looked nice for about a week. They are very comfortable and light weight but they are coming apart after 3 months. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn. Usually, there's a few days of bliss with a new pair of wide toe box shoes when my toes are relieved from their former prisons. Then, my toes get used to the room and want more, or I just settle for the least uncomfortable shoes I can find. These shoes I've been wearing non-stop since they arrived and loving them. Felt great at first. Great customer service. Honestly, Im not sure how long a shoe will last when subjected to extreme conditions, especially salt. For me, personally, if I get a year out of mine, Im happy. With customer service like that, and the fit being good, its an easy 5 stars. For sizing help, i wear a 9.5 in a 'glove' with a thumbs width of extra space, ordered a 10 in these and my big toe bumps the front. That said, they fit really well. Snug up well in the heel and midfoot and much roomier toe box. No arch support, these soles are flat :) They are comfortable with and without the insole, thick and thin socks. Wore 3+ mi the first couple days, 6.5 the third across rocky hills and like the feel. No slipping, seems like good traction, a lot more ground feel than I'm used to but not harsh.

He's got wide and flat feet, so good arch supports are a must. He loves them. He's had them for roughly a week and every time he gets home from the gym makes mention of how great his feet feel. In his words, ""these shoes are snug, but in a good way. These are simply the best running shoes you are going to find. It helps because your foot tends to spread out when you run. You can not go wrong with Brooks though. Maybe they work well for smaller runners. Im 64 210lbs and I need a lot of ankle support. These shoes look great but thats about it for me anyway.

785	5	Saucony Zealot ISO 2	['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Low-cut running shoe featuring mesh upper and lacing overlays with cutouts', 'ISOFIT construction for flexible fit', 'EVERUN topsole cushioning', 'Shock-absorbing SRC Landing Zone']	I loved the old zealots and have gone through 3 pair of the most comfortable running shoes I have ever owned, so when i got to 300 miles on the old pair I decided to give these a try--and was originally very happy I did. I very rarely leave a critical review, but in this case I believe it is necessary to inform buyers this shoe is not what the manufacturer describes it to be. The GOOD: It has a strong rigid sole with minimal cushioning. It wraps tightly around the foot, great for those with high arches and narrow feet. This would be a superb race day shoe for cross-country runners suited to grass or reasonable soils. It is definitely not. Buy a whole size larger than you normally would to fit. I've been wearing Saucony off and on since 1981 and don't relish giving a bad review, but this is not as advertised. It's still a good shoe for minimalist lightweight runners in a limited niche, but not as a high cushion trainer, because that it definitely is not. These are my favorite shoes to date. Fit to my feet is excellent and they are one of the few shoes that I can wear without an insert (slightly high arch and not to wide in toe box) which saves quite a bit of $. In my experience certain shoe companies tend to fit certain feet shapes. These shoes also have a 4mm drop which they is a great compromise between cushion and flats for these 64 year old legs. Highly recommend this shoe if the last is right for your type of foot. Would not recommend it if you were happy with Zealot original try finding it instead of ISO 2. I started wearing Saucony Neutral running shoes a couple years back, and they are fantastic shoes for a neutral runner looking for some cushioning. These shoes look great and when I tried them on I could feel the cushioning, like some of my previous Sauconys, however, these shoes did not fit me in length. Just like other reviews stated, Saucony keeps on making their shoe smaller for the same size, I use to wear a 12.5, in the Zealots 13 is too small and 14 is too much of a size jump. Hopefully they correct the issue in feature releases. Had to order this one size larger, but once I got the size right, it fit really well. Have over 60 miles on these and ran a half marathon in them with a new PR. So far I really like these. They are super stable and lightweight. They also seem to be holding up really well, so I'm expecting to get at least 300 miles out of these. They're not quite as cushy as the Brooks Ghost, but otherwise they are a great shoe. Love it. Colors are fun and it feels nice on the feet when you're running, especially since I'm trying to teach myself how to properly run (not heel striking). However, the front part of the shoe is a bit small, but an easy fix is to wear thinner socks. Other than that, a great shoe, I bought this to fix my shin splint problems, so I am looking forward to a quick recovery with my favorite brand. The length/width/arch combination makes some shoes work better for people than others. FWIW, I've got fairly long, narrow feet with high arches, and this is the best all-around shoe I've ever had	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Zealot-Running-Shoe/dp/B01GILIB78?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B019QXGVHM&psc=1

Got them in black/black and I'm fascinated by the minimalistic top of the shoe, flat and sober laces, no stitches, flaps, or stripes; just one flat piece of synthetic material with printed pattern on it. I bought this shoe because I liked the Skechers GoRun 5, but I needed more cushioning for longer runs. For now, I've relegated it for walking duties: I get all the comfort without the pain. these fit just like every other pair that i have had in the past and support my feet like i need my shoes to. they are snug without being too tight and dont squeak when i walk on tile or linoleum .

So, while they are a little more snug than what I prefer, I'll know better what to size to buy next time. I had a pair of the first Kismet model and loved those running shoes. These fit a little tighter than the old ones originally did but I think they'll loosen up as I start logging miles. Otherwise, they feel great. I switched over to this style since developing runner's knee and have never had a problem with it since. They help me maintain better form. Definitely smaller than Kismet 1. Go up 1/2 size if you want to upgrade to Kismet 2. Feels like your walking on clouds. Love to run in them. Will never buy another brand again Good shoe.

They fit well, and have been great on the trails, but are coming apart fast. Here's what i found:
-I feel these run just a hair short, which wouldn't be a problem except the upper doesn't hold my foot in place well enough to keep my big toe from repeatedly hitting the front when braking on downhills.
-They don't drain well. I've since corrected this by replacing the insole which soaks up water like a sponge and creating a few small drainage holes in the upper.
-The protection underfoot is great. It is a firm ride but it seems to work for me.
-The traction/grip is adequate but not fantastic on wet rock.
-They transition from trail to road pretty well. Good for that long trail race that has a few miles on road. I wouldn't wear these for a 50k or shorter on very muddy terrain; I have other shoes that perform better on that terrain. Worked very well. Never really had a problem with traction. Could use a little more cushion, but very happy. The logo graphics are peeling off which is not a major complaint for me. Therefore where I would normally wear an 8.5 in New Balance or 9.0 in Adidas or NIke, the 9.0 INOV8 is a perfect fit for me. some of the questions are too generalized, like ""how long can you wear them comfortably.

2) My last shoes were the size 8 Nike Flex Run 2013 (Neutral shoe) and size 8 Mizuno Inspire 11 (Stability). Both fit me perfectly. Cat peed on the Mizunos though lol. This shoe...
1) Great looking shoe that looks to have an AMAZING build quality.
2) One of the most narrow shoes I've tried. I would need to go up at least to a size 8.5.
3) Doesn't seem like a ton of arch support. I think these are best for low arch or flat feet. But medium should be fine too. I had to return due to finding a better deal though on a different shoe. Wish I could have kept them, but I was a little worried about the arch support. Highly recommend if you are a low-medium arch person though. Read more I love this brand, make great shoes at a reasonable price. I don't think you be disappointed if you give him a shot, I love them..... They fit my feet perfectly and are the most comfortable shoes I own for runs and long walks. When I find the perfect shoe, I stock up for a couple of years. These are perfect. I only like to do my daily walk/run in Saucony shoes and Omni 14 is my current favorite. I run a couple miles every day - on the road.These shoes are good because they provide a little more cushioning that some running shoes. They're not soft and spongy, but they're better than trail shoes when running on the road. For me, the ankle part is a little wider than expected, so it doesn't fit snugly, but the rest of the show fits well I have been wearing Omni's since 12s. They provide the right amount of arch support for me without going overboard. I never feel pain or fatigue in my feet from wearing these. I'm really glad to see Saucony producing a pair of Omni's in the 14 series that were extremely neutral colors. I love the black and gray. I've also tried Oasis sneakers, but they fell funky while I jog, so, right now I am a hardcore fan of Saucony.

- Love the cushion on this model of Omni 14.
- Just the right support on the arch support
- Compare to the other Saucony line, the Omni design isn't too bad, doesn't look too hideous
- The black/grey color is perfect color for me as it is low profile, the way I like it because you can see that many running sneakers out there are jam packed with all the colors in the rainbow. Once you get your hands on these specialty running sneakers, you will never go back to those fashion brand name running sneakers, as those fashion running could do damage to your feet My favorite Saucony was the Grid Cohesion 7 (my favorite of all the running shoes I bought). The Omni 14 is not too bad. The Cohesion 7 is still more comfortable than it but it is more comfortable than my more expensive Brooks GTS 16. I just wish that they will do more of the Cohesion 7 build."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Omni-14-m/dp/B00PJ5HXIS?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07MVWCMWS&psc=1

Keeps messing with my feet b/c you feel like you're stepping on stuff as the sole folds under itself. I have a similar pair of Adidas that my wife bought me as a gift at the start of 2017 that I have enjoyed quite a bit. But these have been, to date, the best shoes I've had save for a pair of Nike's I was given many years ago by a friend. They were starting to show their age and I was interested in a replacement set. While I could not find the exact same shoe, this one is as close to the original as it gets (probably better even). Fits exactly perfectly as the old pair, looks very similar, but better (maybe it's the color blue vs white and black?) I am VERY happy with these shoes, they fit perfectly unlike a pair of Nike running shoes I recently bought of the same size that are actually somewhat small and uncomfortable. I am so glad I bought these, will have to get another similar set soon enough. I bought the Adidas Powerblaze because I liked the way they fit and they were price reduced. What I find is that they are very lightweight, and I believe the cushioning level is perfect. I can go a great distance without unnecessary fatigue, and the foam technology they use adds a nice little pop to every stride. My Under Armour's don't quite provide enough cushioning, which is good for fast sprints, but not as good for long distance running. The Saucony's, I believe, have TOO MUCH cushioning, so my feet feel great, but it's absorbing my power and I've noticed my average times slipping down. I've found these Adidas shoes to be the best of both worlds and they've become my go-to shoes for my every-day runs. I'm a 250# male with high arches looking for a stable and comfortable shoe to use on long walks for exercise. Having already had two left ankle osteotomies because of weakened peroneal tendons and previous sprains and fractures, I need something that properly supports the bottom of my feet and also gives me strong side support to keep my ankles from rotating. Putting my Superfeet inserts in these shoes does help raise my arch support to a proper level, but the lack of side support makes me feel that my feet are shifting around on the padded soles and not kept in normal alignment. I had these shoes sitting in my wishlist for MONTHS before I saved some extra cash to drop the order.... I was SUPER excited to get them and try them. I am very glad I did. In fact a full size bigger (size 13) would not have been a bad fit... but the 12.5 fits perfect. The shoes look WAY better in person than in the pics, they look mean and fast. Perfect for jogging, fitness running, cross-training, the gym and walks. They breath very well, and my feet don't get hot (a lot of that has to do with the socks you wear). Grip and traction is great, even on post rain wet runs. I paired these is a set of Adidas Superlite Climacool socks and its a match made in heaven. My feet stay dry, cool and comfy for all my runs and workouts. The size it too small despite the other two pairs being the same size and fitting well.

I have to admit, though, that any time a company expands from one echelon of gear to another, I approach that line with a healthy dose of skepticism because there is no guarantee that the quality is consistent. I know UA has been producing shoes for several years, but as an Asics devotee, I haven't paid much attention to them. I noticed someone wearing this model of shoes, and I liked their look, so I decided it was worth a gamble. To my surprise, these have become ~ by far ~ the favorite shoe in my closet. They fit perfectly. I hasten to add that I am only wearing them for daily activities, so I'll leave the reviews for true athletic performance to those who are using them in that application. I've always had Nike's, so moving to AA was really quite an emotional experience. But as time progressed, I started to like the comfortability of the shoes. The shoes feel big but comfortably big if that makes sense to you at all. All in all - great product great experience. These shoes are just awesome. They're light as a feather, they breathe really well. I'm so happy. They look cool. My son sees them, doh!!!! (I knew what was coming next) he says, ""Oooooo...I really like these Father!"" Yes, my son actually calls me FATHER. He does it to aggravate me. Black is my favorite color. If I'm not wearing black, I feel weird."" Lol. So, I went on Amazon and crossed my fingers and started searching. There were hundreds of pink, orange, green, yellow..ALL NEON. Or sports shoes, that looked like you had to blow them up before wearing. I ordered them instantly, and I just hoped that the Big A still had these in stock. YES! I said as I pumped my fist like Macaulay Caulkin. ""Do you know how long it takes to actually wear a set of Under Armour shoes out. Well, neither do I because, I've never worn a pair completely out. They just get demoted to ""play shoes."" Now, I know what my size is. THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. First let me make this clear: If you've never purchased Under Armour before, I would strongly advise you to go to a retailer that carries UA clothes and TRY THEM ON! Under Armour's clothes, shoes, socks, and even the hats are really small compared to the sizes that you would normally wear. But there's nothing that feels better, looks good LONGER, practically wrinkle proof, and keeps you cooler in hot muggy weather than Under Armour's gear. Yeah, they're a tad expensive, but the wear you get out of UA clothes is well worth the money. Read more I love this shoe so far. I then found this model, all black and order same size 11.5 as the previous model, except this one fit too tight. This model itself is really nice and that is why I'm not given it a lower rating. First pair are still in good shape after a year of wearing almost all the time around and at gym. These new ones fit a ton better and feel like they have even more support. Hard to find another shoe this good for the money. I was impressed. The shoes look and feel great. They're my first pair of Under Armour shoes and they're perfect. Very nice shoe UNDER ARMOUR! My fiancé LOVES these shoes. We couldn't find his size in stores so thank goodness for Amazon"	https://www.amazon.com/Under-Armour-Micro-Speed-Swift/dp/B00ZV9O5ME?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B078HGYHPP&psc=1
810	0	The North Face Ultra Cardiac	['Fashion Trend: Ankle-High Synthetic Running Shoe']	This is my first running shoe from tnf and they are my favorite. I own several nikes and salomons but these are the most comfortable. The shoes just feel so good on my feet. Must be the excellent cushioning all around. I honestly haven't done any running on them because I don't want to wear them out. They look so good I just wear them around town. I want my toes to move freely in there. Better yet try one out first to know your size. I am definitely buying these shoes again once I wear mine out. Thank you tnf for the awesome shoes. They wore so well and have held up to a couple of washes in the machine so I bought another pair here. My favorite trail running show to date. bought 2 pairs from 6pm.com Had to send back and get a larger size Great shoes but order one half size larger than standard for comfortable fit I love it	https://www.amazon.com/North-Face-Mens-Ultra-Cardiac/dp/B00LMTMOMK?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01MSVZD6O&psc=1

OVERALL RATING by codysuzz: 8.5/10 - I recommend buying these if you are running anywhere from a 5k up to a marathon.

812	2	Newton Gravity 6	['NA', 'Imported', '*NEW* Tongue - Provides a more breathable, flexible mesh.', 'Breathable Mesh - Provides lightweight breathability and structure in key areas.', 'Reinforced Eyelets - Helps provide a secure fit.', '4-Way Stretch Mesh Metatarsal Panel - Offers a more customised fit.', 'Heel Lace Lock - Provides a snug heel lockdown.', 'Size: 8 D(M) US']	For these shoes i paid a great deal of attention to a comment left on the Newton website stating that a new factory was used to construct this generation of shoe and they had a sizing inconsistency. My first pair were the Distance V. They were great and i still use them on occassion. Based on the positive reviews and the fact they had great cushioning I decided to upgrade to them. I had to go up yet another half a size on these Gravity VI. I'm so thankful i heeded the advice of a review on the Newton website. so i now have to go up a whole size from my old ASICS. I also find that the laceup causes some pain on the outside of my ankle where the shoe rubs against it. Otherwise, the shoes are fine and very comfortable. The lugs act as a great guide to help my mid-foot strike, which was the main reason i bought them in the first place This is the next generation of the Newton Gravity. They have had the 5th lug for a couple of generations, which makes cornering better than they were when they were only four. These are not conventional running shoes and do take some adjustment for people that aren't already midfoot/forefoot strikers. The high cost is justified by the fact that they last forever...basically until you physically wear the shoe out...because there isn't really any foam to compress to speak of. You can get 1000 miles out of a pair of Newtons pretty easily. No good. Not fault of reseller. Taking a chance on 'pre-owned' Gravity III's thru ebay as these are what I am currently using as well as my 10.5 Terra Momentum's - no issues with either of these shoes. I have been a fan of Newtons for a long time. The colorway is okay. Very comfortable and great cushioning. A nice upgrade over previous generations. Love these shoes. Perfect for my style of running, they last for about 400 miles... They work great for me with the low toe to heel drop and the lugs under the forefootto too give a nice spring.	https://www.amazon.com/Newton-Running-Mens-Gravity-VI/dp/B01HODH80U?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07C4NJQBK&psc=1

The Velcro tie down system doesnt secure my foot into the heel cup sufficiently and theres enough movement to cause blisters.

Anyway, I like to experiment with different shoes for different training purposes. Lately, I've really enjoyed running in my Kinvara 5s except I knew that, for me, going longer than 10 miles in them could be problematic as it didn't seem to have enough stablility/cushioning. Also, I like the 4mm offset of the Kinvara (as well as the NB Fresh Foam). When these arrived I went for a 10k run the next day and they felt great. One thing about Saucony shoes is that it seems like they only get better after 4-5 runs so I was happily surprised that these were good right out of the gate. The ""plushiness"" of the shoes was not so much that I felt like I was bouncing around and that was important to me. And the shoes did not seem to be that much more weight than the Kinvara/NB Fresh Foam. From a durability standpoint, the upper is well constructed and has some nice support at the front and rear of the shoe (take a closer look at the pics for a closer look). The toebox is roomy and fit my feet well as I have somewhat flat feet; no hot spots for me. I picked the blue/citron color and it looks great. Because I like these shoes so much I will definitely get the other color combination to rotate between the pairs. From a weight standpoint pespective: Virrata < Fasttwitch < Fresh Foam < Kinvara or Gel Lyte < Zoot TT 6 < Cortana 4 < Ride 7 < Guide 7 > Kayano 19

The only con of this shoe is the price: $150 is quite steep in today's running shoe market given the competition and choices. I burned through my Amazon points to get to a decent price level. Read more Great shoes, I went through 2 pairs of Cortana 2 and decided to go back and try the 4s. They are lightweight but reasonably stiff sole makes you feel like you are getting a lot of support with a neutral minimal drop shoe. Felt great on the first run. I would consider these to be a good high mileage shoe, I am going to use them for my current training and October marathon I go back and forth with these shoes. When I first bought them, I loved them instantly. I have been wearing these again the last two weeks and they are great again. Super light, good cushion, enough stability for those who need it. These shoes are plush, but responsive, flexible, but stable, and have best uppers you'll ever try. Great lightweight running shoe for me. I can't comment on arch support since I use custom orthotics with them. The toebox has good room and there's good cushioning for the mid to forefoot. Fit perfect. Put a lot of miles on them all ready. My husband loves these running shoes. I hope they last for a long time. He does not wear them for running but for overall comfort. They have great arch and heel support which is important to him.

After some time to wear them, they seem like a great fit so far. Since being diagnosed with a morton's neuroma I've found altras are the only shoe I can really wear that doesn't case pain. The combination of a wide toe box, zero drop and good cushioning work really well for me. They seem to offer the comfort of other altras, combined with more substantial support and stability, while also being waterproof. So far they seem to breathe quite well for a waterproof shoe and the fabric doesn't look like it's some special waterproof material (nice and thin). They fit similar to the escalantes while being a little more substantial and not quite as flexible. I do wish altra would start making shoes in more subdued styles though. I chose the blue because it looked less ridiculous but I still don't think it's the best looking shoe around. I'd love a simple black design. While they do make some more casual style shoes which would be more appropriate for my use, this seems to be the only waterproof shoe they are making at the moment making it the best fit for my needs... Read more Love the soft sole. The broader toe box creates a really different-feeling shoe, at first it felt like they didn't fit. But, after running with them a few times, I ""got used"" to them; now I would call them a good shoe. For what it's worth, I solved my toe-blister issue by using ""toe socks""; e.g. socks with five glove-like separations for each toe. They are available here on Amazon and I highly recommend them. PS The Lone Peak design on these shoes is extremely cool. I'm an older guy who doesn't run or backpack anymore, but every morning without fail I walk my dog in the morning after doing morning exercises; 2.2 miles up and down hills rain or shine. They're light and feel good when walking. I loves the shoes, out of the box comfort great traction extremely comfortable. I like the fit to my feet. So far so good.

They fit well and so far so good during workouts. I like the overall design and the one piece sock/bootie concept. I wish the material was a bit tighter fit over the top and sides of the foot. I have to cinch it tight to keep from feeling like Im flopping around in clown shoes. I like they are very light and the sole moves nicely, but I could do with a little more cushioning. I have not done any serious runs in them and use them mostly for little run/walks with my dog around the neighborhood and occasionally at the gym. I love these shoes, tennis shoes or what ever. They work great for me working out 4 to 5 times a week. I also love that I dont need socks with these. I have a couple other pairs that I use just for casual dress. Make more colors My oldest son absolutely loves these. My favorite thing is that they look good on. Some of the modern sneakers look like space boots. These look nice and fit him well. Pretty comfy shoe. I think it will be OK for linear running and most weight lifting. But I wish it had a bit more support /structure. It looks great, with a minimalist style.

In spring, summer, and fall I never avoid getting my feet wet on runs or hikes, but I want them to dry as soon as possible, so waterproof / ""breathable"" membranes are the last thing I need in a shoe. Seems like that's mostly for casual wearers who don't want wet socks from puddles at the mall. The outsole, midsole, and uppers on these felt great - again, exactly what I wanted. I already wore the 13's too much to return, so perhaps I can tolerate them for casual wear (to the mall!), but I'm still looking for a good breathable, synthetic (quick-drying), mid-height trail runner. Please, all manufacturers - stop feeling false pressure from your marketing people to label every single trail shoe as ""waterproof"" and certainly not waterproof and ""breathable"", which is practically false advertising. You've seen adventure races on TV, right. Help us leave that water behind with shoes that drain and truly breathe without any silly membranes. Read more Highly recommend. I ordered these in 11.5 to wear thicker socks during cool weather. Good thing I did as these fit a 1/2 size smaller even compared to my other Inov8s, BUT i think it may simply be a slightly narrower toe box on this compared to their other shoes. With that odd bit of information I'll let you make your decision on the best size but I would recommend a 1/2 size larger. The other issue was the width of the shoe was off as well. So unless you have tiny narrow woman feet don't order the shoes I love these light hiking boots. I do a lot of long distance fast packing, trail running and a huge variety of competitive endurance sports. Easily up to 30 miles or more per run. INOV8 do fit small but that is an easy adjustment. These look great on the trail or in the mall shopping with family. One of my favorites right now. Just a heads up, YOU NEED TO GO UP A FULL SIZE. if you want to wear thick socks think about a size and a half. A very nice boot otherwise. I love the traction and the lightness. Great ground feel. Very good traction in loose conditions as well as on rocks and hard surfaces. Breath well in hot conditions. Only thing to wat h for is fit. In theseihad to go up to an 11 to get acceptable width and toe room. I got these at 8pm on a Wednesday and they were strapped to my feet for a very intense physical training on Thursday morning at 6am. The first day wearing these I wore for 18 hours straight. Never had a single sore foot moment or wished I had them off. These shoes were great, straight out of the box. I'm super glad I purchased them and can't stop wearing them. I have been in Afghanistan for about a year now and I always wore merrils, I decided to give these a try and I love them they are perfect for the terrain here in Afghanistan and have the same comfort level as a walking/running shoe. I will be buying a second pair in a different color however, I highly recommend going up at least a half size."	https://www.amazon.com/Inov-8-Mens-Roclite-Trail-Runner/dp/B01KIG86ZQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01IK1MVQ6&psc=1

Well, the right one fit as expected but the left was like 3/4 too small. It stretched out after two weeks so its OK now. I'm noticing other portions of the tread are separating on the other shoe as well. Dropping from 4 stars to 3 stars. shoe runs narrow like Pumas and i have narrow feet so if you have moderate to wider feet, definitely get the wides. Shoes still looked new but i can tell someone tried it one and walked around outside with it but i guess thats Amazon for you these days, all 2nd rate, customer returns, open box, blemished/refurb or closeout stuff sold as new. This is a shoe with the perfect amount of cushioning for most purposes, especially if you wear orthotics. It is a very comfortable mid weight shoe that because of its color can be worn for most occasions. Just like all ASICS I have owned, these are very comfortable and support my feet well. The best running/workout shoes I've ever owned. I like the quality, look and feel. The right shoe made a squeaking noise straight out of the box and never stopped. So it sounded like you had a suction cup on your right foot	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-fuzeX-Rush-Running/dp/B01N0B55T5?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0714G8J2L&psc=1

Comfortable inside and they've got fantastic traction. Better on bicycle pedals than other sneakers/shoes, too. The shoes feels very light and the sole provides great comfort, however the shoes were just a little narrow for my feet. Other than that, the shoes' build and feel quality is very good. I love the Zigs. Had problems with heels and being on my feet for 8+ hour shifts as RN and these are great. These are a solid fit. I enjoy wearing them. Otherwise very great fit Was a bit hesitant buying shoes online, but i knew amazon would have my back if there were any issues. So i bit the bullet and tried these sneakers out and I am glad I did. These fit perfectly and provide a great amount of support I used them hiking through Arizona dessert and mnts so far. I now use them daily in the gym, great buy you wont be disappointed. They look good, and are the right size. Bought these for my 14 year old son and he loves them. They look nice and he says they are very comfortable.	https://www.amazon.com/Reebok-CM9827-Mens-Zigpulse-SE-Sneaker/dp/B073XC6348?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B073WSS5LM&psc=1

These shoes are incredibly comfortable and stable in all terrain. The Jazz O will always be my favorite Saucony but these are awesome on trails. Just the right amount of foot padding, making it a very comfortable walking/light hiking sneaker. My 6'4"", 240 pound husband says it's a really great shoe for him and has just the right amount of support for his weight and height. I've run with them a couple of times and they have nice cushion and bounce. Second pair of Saucony shoes I buy, and definitely I will continue buy this brand in the future. I think a mid sole with more cushion would be nice. I like this shoes so much, and the design is bold and pretty Very comfortable. I have always liked Saucony shoes and these do not disappoint. I have high arches and these are listed as normal arch height but they have plenty of arch support for me. I use them for every day wear and playing outdoor sports like softball where the extra traction is needed. Good shoe. Read the reviews and thought I was getting a good shoe for some trail running. Luckily I can still tie them using the alternate eylets but it makes the shoe very tight at the top of my foot. Great trail running shoe. Fits well with good traction. I am a mid foot striker and find these good for holding my foot position without requiring heavy lace pressure."	https://www.amazon.com/Saucony-Mens-Caliber-Trail-Runner/dp/B01GJYDGU6?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01HYJC2KU&psc=1

I use Sof-Sol, air-plus, or other brand inserts designed to provide better cushioning and support. (If you're over 200 lbs you should probably try a heavier-duty shoe.) Try experiment with sock thickness or insoles before you give up on the Nimbus. It remains one of the technically best running shoes in the industry. He loves the fit, he wears a 13M. He is so pleased with this pair of running shoes, that went he get home from his run he can leave them in the sun and they dry up within hours, from him sweating all over them. He loves that they are lite-weight and yet very comfortable while running his eight miles a day. He also likes these in the tri-color combos. Thanks a lot Asics. Toe box is significantly smaller when compared to my previous models, I love the regular gel nimbus 16, 17 and 18. The color did not match the ones from the picture , they looked more like a giant blueberry. I bought these for my husband and he loves them. Says they are very comfortable. My husband has wide Flintstone (no arch) feet, so its hard to find good shoes. Like so many others have said, go a half size larger.

Perfect shoes and comfortable Great light trail shoe. Very comfortable. I have been wearing a pair of these for about a month and I find them to be incredibly comfortable. The shape of the shoe has a pretty wide toebox, which suits me fine because I have trouble finding shoes that are wide enough. On the other hand, the shoe feels great to my somewhat bony heel. I had a pair of Altras which were almost as comfortable, but they wore out in a few months. I loved the original Runventure. It was almost perfect. I'd prefer the original Runventure forefoot stack height of 17mm.
- Great gaiter system. Although the seams on the gaiters started to come apart during my first run.
- Rock plate: Why mess with a good thing. I chose the grey to help keep my feet slightly cooler in the sun. I loved the original vibrant red color. If you're used to the original, you'll definitely feel the extra ounce or two.

I'm a big fan of Salomon sneakers and own quite a few pairs. I put many miles on each pair and they look as good as the day I bought them. The shell/ body of the sneaker are well made, but the downfall is that for the miles I power walk that I do, the sole of the sneakers wear down after 8/9 months. When it's time to trash the sneaker, they still look good as when you bought them. I'm still looking for sneakers that have tough soles that can handle MANY miles, recommendations would be appreciated. As to wear for normal walk and activity, these are great and look good. Great price for a good running shoe for wide feet. They are comfortable and fit true to size and my feet felt great after running sprints in them for over an hour. Salomon provided a lot of support on the sides of the shoes which are great on uneven surfaces so you don't turn your ankle. These not only hold up but they also don't stink. Lol. I like everything from the unique lacing system to the overall construction. Great shoes for vegans as well. Have bought 3 pairs of Salomons so far and find them to be the most comfortable sports shoe I have ever owned. I have Nikes and Adidas as well as several other brands but Salomons are now my go to brand. As well as comfort they have great style and tread. Mac So far very happy with the show.

They fit so perfectly that they reveal the nuances in your feet. 2 socks on my right foot, 1 on the left and tied them both fairly loosely and for me the fit is ideal. As purported they provide excellent arch support (my arches are extreme) and they greatly reduce surface impact transfer. I was an ASICS fan until now. I hope these are as durable and enduring. Didn't know what to expect but really glad I purchased. I've only done 2 runs in these but really like the way they feel. Great arch support. I was nervous at first because they felt sort of hard when I was walking around but the minute I started running, they felt super comfortable. I did an hour run the first time and my legs felt fresh after, usually a good sign. By far my favorite running shoe Ive ever owned. Ive got my eyes set on a few other models Id like to try.

852	12	Merrell Trail Crusher	['100% Mesh/TPU/Synthetic Leather Upper', 'Imported', 'Rubber sole', 'Removable Insole']	Great shoe, if you are looking for a minimalist trail shoe for neutral pronation. If you are okay with a light, neutral shoe, this one works great on pavement and dry trails that aren't too rocky or as a leightweight everyday shoe if you do a lot of walking. The laces are better and a smoother ride than mixmaster series. Good shoes. I find highly textured surfaces are tough on my feet/legs, things like anti-slip grates or plastic mats. Concrete, grass, tracks, and other flat surfaces are great. It's like vented socks. The water goes both ways, though, so careful about puddles and sprinklers. I needed squishy insoles to make them feel just right, you can feel right through them almost like being barefoot. Otherwise I love these, and am disappointed. As close as I could get to my old Merrell Mix Master 2s which I loved (owned 3 pairs). Love the low drop. It's an improvement over my broken down and worn out shoes, but new shoe to new shoe, the older ones are better. The fit is proper and they seem to be holding up over the past week or so that I've owned them. I like the shoes otherwise, they fit great and are very comfortable, but this is an unacceptable level of wear. they are used for every day casual wear and the gym, they are not used for any running workouts.	https://www.amazon.com/Merrell-Mens-Crusher-Trail-Runner/dp/B0193TGHYQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01AK32B5I&psc=1

854	14	Zoot Solana ACR	"['100% Synthetic', 'Imported', 'Synthetic sole', 'Shaft measures approximately Low-Top"" from arch', 'Lace-up running shoe with weather-resistant upper featuring padded collar and BareFit internal construction for comfort', 'ZVA compression-molded midsole', 'Dri-Lex anti-microbial lining', '', '']"	"I bought this shoe after reading about its waterproof and water resistant abilities both on its description on the Amazon website and on various running websites. I have waterproof shoes, the Saucony Xodus GTX trail shoes and an older pair of Reebok GoreTex trail shoes (which I use to run in the snow/ice in the winter) but the trail shoes have too stiff a sole to run in a long distance race like the marathon or even half. I thought that the waterproof/water resistant properties would be similar to those of GoreTex branded shoes like the Brooks Ghost GTX and other running shoes. This sole is flexible and gives the runner a good feeling when the sole hits the pavement.
? The shoe has a thick velvet-like interior that is very comfortable to the wearer. My shoes were black and green and the interior was bright light green.
? The shoes' insoles were thicker than most of the shoes I have seen. This is one of the few shoes where you can use the stock insoles without using the aftermarket running insoles like Dr Scholl's. I did a 10 and 13 miler without any adverse effects from not using a reinforced insole. Their flexibility means that they might feel weird the first two or three times you wear them but after walking and running with them for a while, then they conform to your foot and any weird feeling goes away.
? They are also comfortable walking shoes but some reviewers claim that they wear out fast, so I would use them for running on the road only. I wouldn't advise anyone to use them on trails, especially wet trails.
? Their lower soles grip the asphalt and pavement well, even in the rain and provide excellent traction.
? The shoes are not waterproof, nor are they water resistant. Maybe not.
? They feel 'breathable' and don't get hot on 90 degree days, but that's because they allow water (and air) to soak and move in and out.
? I bought a shoe water proof treatment spray (Sofsole brand) to at least salvage the shoe as a water resistant shoe.
? I would give this shoe a 1 star for what I would regard as false advertising on its water resistant properties. However, as I was taking this shoe for my medium and long runs (7, 10, 13 and 15 miler) I realized one amazing thing... This shoe has a sweet spot where it combines the qualities of a well cushioned shoe with the ability of the shoe to 'connect' to the road. Maximalist shoes provide excellent cushioning but some runners feel 'disconnected' to the road. This shoe merges the two advantages. I am a recent Hoka One One recruit and run in the thick soled Hoka Mafate so that I can
preserve my knees but I would recommend this shoe for a runner who wants cushioning and the feel of the road. A lighter runner would get even more advantages by using this shoe. So, in short, if you are buying this shoe primarily for its waterproof properties, you are better off buying an actual waterproof Goretex shoe that will actually repel water. However, it's an excellent running shoe, especially for a lighter runner seeking both cushioning and the feel of the road. Read more The reason I bought this shoe is because it was an award winner in Runner's World. This shoe fits really good and has good room in the toebox. It has the perfect balance between cushioning and responsiveness, it's quite light and it won't get soaked in a rainstorm. I typically love Zoot shoes. I don't plan to buy Zoot again. one of my favorite running shoes now. I had done some research on what kind of shoes i needed for running as i am in the military and they give you whatever the f@*% they have on hand. I usually buy Nike but I got a great deal on mine due to being a size 13. The shoe if very lightweight and comfortable. I wish they had a 13.5 but the 13 fits okay. Wanted to clear that up first, these shoes are the most comfortable Zoots I've tried so far. I need good arch support and stiff soles, these aren't as stiff as some tri shoes I've tried but they are soooo comfy I happen to be a Zoot fan, it it's difficult to find these shoes directly through Zoot, not to mention expensive"	https://www.amazon.com/Zoot-Mens-Solana-Running-Shoe/dp/B00HHIUUX0?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00JN60LVA&psc=1

Excellent. These are a good exemplar that that is unnecessary.), and they offer good support in the mid foot and heel while still absorbing shock. Aside from the pinch, the shoes themselves are comfortable. I ordered these shoes because I had a pair of New Balance fresh foam 980s previously. The tread is more aggressive than my old pair, not a bad thing by any means. These shoes are super comfortable and fit as expected. I really wished they would've made these shoes in black and silver but this color combo is good too. If you are looking for a good cross trainer style shoe that will hold up well give these shoes a shot. Fresh Foams have been the most comfortable shoes that I have owned and I hope New Balance continues this line of shoes. Great looking shoe, but it takes me 5 minutes to even get them on my feet. This would be my favorite shoe of all time if they were available in a wide width. And I have skinny feet Comfortable shoe. So far, so good. The 1/2 size increase allowed for a more comfortable fit.

But that's there the good ends. I cannot and will not recommend these shoes, especially if you are actually planning on trail running, or running of any kind. Granted I wear them a lot the breathable makeup of these shoes are apparently fragile and are disintegrating daily to the point of holes forming on both sides of the toe box on both shoes. Update;
I wore these shoes 2 times a week to go play disc golf during 2018. I noticed a hole begin on my right foot, near my pinky toe, that gets bigger every time I play. Surprising the grip has stayed true for the entire year until it began to come of little by little. Other than those complaints, over the past year they worked just great on the course. For the price of the shoes I definitely got my moneys worth, but I will not be repurchasing them. So far they have been amazing. This particular pair is alright. My only issue with this specific pair is that when I opened up the shoe box , it had a very strong distinct smell. I couldn't figure it out until my sister got a whiff of it when she walked by me and said "" wow, did you put moth balls inside those shoes ? "" the scent is very strong . I mean did they stocked this where they needed moth balls? its been two days since i received the pair and i can clearly smell it still. I work outdoors and bought these because I figured trail running shoes would be more durable but comfortable like running shoes, and also to wear for occasional runs in the woods. I'm not dissapointed, these shoes are super comfy and have great grip and durability. They look great too. Haven't worn running yet but they seem like they will hold up great. I'm dissapointed I could have bought a really cheap pair of tennis shoes that hold up better. Barely ran in these so thank god I didn't purchase them for trail running because I can't imagine them lasting more then a few runs. They look and feel very nice, but they won't last. It's like one layer of really light, soft, cotton, brittle protection. i have a pair in both blue(to wear to the gym and when riding my bike)) and grey(wearing out and about) and they are very comfortable!! definitely a great sneaker to buy. love reebok. have outlasted my asics and nikes that cost twice to three times as much and they don't hold up nor feel as comfortable to wear. Mostly trying to get a descent shoe without a crazy price tag. These shoes accomplished that. They have very good heal support and feel solid. Running in them feels natural and they are very breathable. The top mesh let's air flow through without having that cheep mesh look. I would definitely recommend these shoes to a friend."	https://www.amazon.com/Reebok-Mens-Ridgerider-Trail-Running/dp/B01HSWK85O?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01NCERTZX&psc=1

I was AMAZED that I finally found a shoe the was foot shaped with a wide toe box and fit a wide foot all the way around my foot. I liked the Timps so much I bought a pair of the Mid hight Lone Peak 4 for when I want more ankle support. These did not disappoint either. If you have a narrow foot, like my wife, then I would look elsewhere. The rear end of the soles get caught by anything pretty much (roots, rocks, etc). The toes area should be more protective or have better and stronger protection.. it gets scratched easily, and make then start falling apart even after the first time of running with them. This shoe is a major improvement from the 3.5 version. The toe box is still wide as with all altras, but the arch and heel seem to fit more narrow than the previous versions. The upper material seems to be more resilient and helps keep your foot in place. The fit and comfort are great. If you are on the fence with these boots, I can tell they will help if you have the same condiction with your feet. I am an avid outdoorsman and a former scout leader. These are the best. Very comfortable, amazingly durable, light as a feather, and water resistant. This is a very good choice if you are in the same path. This is my first pair of Altra boots and I was impressed with the comfort of thes shoes. These are very lightweight and fit a wide foot very comfortably. The insole gives good cushioning. The company recommends switching between these and regular shoes every other day to get used to this difference. My initial impression is wow!. These foot shaped bottoms take the cake when it comes to compromise over multiple weekly 3-5 miles trail runs over sharp rocks, natural trails.	https://www.amazon.com/Altra-Mens-Lone-Trail-Running/dp/B079RH7WKB?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B07GZVR375&psc=1

(My biggest problem with shoes is my high arches.)
I bought a pair of ASICS before I purchased these. The arch support was more than I thought it would be. (It was good.)
That being said, I purchased these. (I liked the look & the price was good.) Although the support was there, I was surprised at the weight. GOOD DEAL. I tried a 13 on in Kohls, all they had, and like the fit and feel, but these days I'm usually ending up with size 14 or maybe 13.5 if available. So I ordered a pair of size 14 on Amazon. So far the are great. They are a D width, but are narrow for a D. But for me that is great because I have torpedo's attached to my ankles and often my feet swim in size D. So if you are snug in a D, these will probably be too snug for you. I saw another reviewer comment like that as well. I'm finally replacing them because I can't imagine the inner sole support hasn't decayed, although they still feel very good on my feet. I have high arches, so I may add a little additional arch support to these at some point, but for others, that may not be a factor. This was a great price for such a great shoe. These shoes have been great for me. They are very comfortable and look great. I would definitely recommend these shoes for people that do not want to spend $100+ for running shoes. Hoping the replacement Nimbus model ordered, is up to Asics' usual good standards. Asics wear much better than Brooks which are my favorites for comfort & support. I am not exaggerating at all. He is on his feet all day and needs good support for his feet. He's very pleased with the fit and comfort of these shoes. We haven't been able to find this size in any local stores (and we live in a good sized city) so we are pleased that we ended up with a good fit on our first try. My husband has other athletic and dress shoes that are a size 14 that fit him perfectly. Curious why the change in sizing of shoes. Also comfortable AF!!. This is the second pair of these I have ordered from Amazon. They are a great running shoe. I just used the laces from the fist pair as they were still good."	https://www.amazon.com/ASICS-Mens-GEL-Exalt-Running-Shoe/dp/B00GUQVMM8?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00GV2ZN76&psc=1

My current pair of running shoes is the original gel hyper tri. The original hyper tri breathed allowing your feet to stay relatively cool even in the Texas summer heat but this one has so much additional insulation it felt like my feet were burning up... Asics also claims it is a shoe with neutral support but it feels like additional reinforcement was added to outside edge of the shoe to compensate for rolling your feet. I am sure this shoe is probably perfect for someone but it is just too different from the original gel hyper tri. I wear 11 for day to day, 11.5 for running shoes.. ordered a 12 for these shoes and they fit snug but not too bad. Switched over to the elastic laces and they slide onto bare feet pretty well. I hate to say it but I have not run in these yet, just practiced putting them on and made sure the fit was good. I am not super picky about running shoes so I am sure they will do fine. The big hole in the tongue is cool. If anything youd probably want a Tri shoe to be a little roomier so itll slide on easily. I've only worn these to try them on so far but the others were right, order a half size up and that's what your size would feel like in the Noosas. ASICS is my go to brand, and I LOVED the Gel-Noosa Tri product, which has been discontinued. Very light and have great response but as others have written and I just experienced after 8 miles they do run small. I didn't notice the smallness until the longer run today The Tri laces make the shoe fit tighter than it should. going up a half size may be the way to go. Great running shoes, very light and good grip. Easy to slide your feet in, as it comes with elastic laces.

877	7	Nike Free RN Motion Flyknit	['Synthetic', 'Synthetic sole', 'Style: Fitness & Cross-Training', 'Closure Type: Lace Up', 'Material: Synthetic', 'Sole Material: Manmade', 'Shoe Height: Low & Mid Tops']	"I thought I found the ultimate comfort shoe when I bought a pair of Nike Free 3.0 shoes several years ago  then I bought the FREE RN MOTION FLYNITS.

The problem with Nike is that the latest and greatest designs are like Haleys Comet  their here for a moment and gone forever (yeah, they brought back the Cortez, but they arent the same). I loved the Free 3.0 for being so lightweight and breathable  you barely noticed they were on and they were surprisingly durable. Looking to replace my well-worn Free 3.0s was not easy, because my favorite aspect was seamless one-piece uppers (no tongue)  like my old Air Huaraches from the 1990s. The only shoe similar to my beloved Free 3.0s was the RN MOTION FLYNITS  they had similar features, including the one-piece upper. I wasnt sure Id like the Flyknit material, but realize thats was gives the uppers such a comfortable, but durable stretching ability. The soles of these shoes are made of lightweight rubber with deep treads that allow the material to move side-to-side as well as front-to-back for a cloud-like cushion. Like the other Free Run designs, there are strategically placed hard-rubber segments on the soles typical wear-spots (outer heel and inner toe). The best part is that they are sock-like (no tongue), so they fit like a glove. While they do have laces, they are more for locking the shoes to your feet rather than offering support. Extremely comfortable, lightweight and durable  worth every penny. Read more I love these shoes for both casual cruising around and (separately) intense rebounding exercises on sidewalk or paved surfaces. Get these while you can, they are no longer being made and the newer version (""Nike Free RN Motion Flyknit 2017"") has eliminated the flywire, laces and tubules that trace the shoe upper surface. Although I do really like the newer '2017' version... it is a completely differently purposed shoe. I think Nike should have kept this previous shoe available, perhaps with minimal updates, and introduced a new line extension for the Nike Free RN Motion Flyknit 2017 instead of eliminating and replacing this shoe. Once I saw what the new Nike Free RN Motion Flyknit had become for 2017 I bought another pair of this 2016 previous version. I said 'fit as expected', because I expect Nike to fit ~1/2 size small relative to some brands. Most incredibly comfortable shoes ever. When cinched appropriately, they allow the tendons on the top of the foot and the front of the ankle to flex liquidly, but also the shoes hug and cradle the foot. Extremely light weight and flexible shoe. Fits like a sock, nothing rubs. Oddly warm for such a minimalist shoe, but not terrible. I'm getting more pairs in case they stop making them, I like it that much. The support is way too loose laterally. The sole is impossible to keep clean. Only good for looks and for a house slipper. Probably my favorite pair of shoes I've ever owned. Insanely comfortable, and they've held up really well to the abuse I give them. Highly recommend. Love the shoes though. Perfect for light jogs and the gym. Go great with anything. I have a wide foot so getting shoes can be a challenge. That being said, I like the shoes and they fit somewhat small but with this type of shoe, snug fit is required. soft, comfortable, very happy with the snikers... its a pity they arent made anymore"	https://www.amazon.com/Nike-FreeRn-Motion-Flyknit-Running/dp/B01GYR22XA?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B01KIMIFO2&psc=1

I walk about 5 miles a day and these shoes with socks are perfect. The are very comfortable and supportive. I had a pair of Zoots before and wore them out after a couple of years; but they gave great wear. They are a nice fitting, lightweight shoe. First of all i am not qualified to a very qualified opinion as a Beginner but my personal experience with just wearing The Kalani 3.0 once at the track for 5 KM is a very soft and confortable shoe ( my weight is 145 lbs, 5'9"" ). also fits well but a little snug maybe next time i will buy a half number bigger and i have skinny feet.
i ran in them sock less ( which i tought i was never going to be albe to ) and it was great. the upper part is very confortable. my recommendation if you are looking for a stable and cushion shoe with a confortable ride these will do it. i have had the Nimbus 14 and a big no no for me. Also have the Mizuno Wave Precision 13 and they are very nice ( also recommended even though they were discontinued and the New Sayonara is not up to it ) but i feel better in the Kalani 3.0.
as i said if you can not try it first it may be recommended you go for half a size bigger than your usual.
also i have just wear it once. Great shoe. The Ultra Kalani is a great fit, comfortable for higher mileage. Running Shoes fit is so variable from person to person, but Zoot keeps it simple and this allows for a good fitting high performance shoe for more people. Kalani is fast slip on shoe great for races but also hold up. I put 350-450 mi on each pair of Zoots that I buy before I retire them and the cost is way better. Hope the Kalani is the same. This is a fairly comfortable sockless running shoe. I purchased some Lace-Locks and that works fine. Very nice for the money, I like the tongue and how they slip on. I like and would recommend for the money. They are among the most comfortable shoes I've owned. They do take some effort to get on and off when they're brand new, butit's worth the effort. I love the ""sock"" style - no separate tongue - and they are just comfy. I took the advice and bought the half size larger and the fit is perfect. I love these shoes they are comfortable and the ability to wear them without socks is a huge plus, no more hot feet. I have ran several miles in them since I purchased them and the are holding up well. I will definitely purchase another pair when these wear out. These shoes are awesome. I have loved Zoot runners for a while, and these are no exception. They hug my feet in a way that makes me feel like I can fly"	https://www.amazon.com/Zoot-Mens-Ultra-Kalani-Running/dp/B00DM0NBAQ?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B00AJCYT60&psc=1

I generally wear Saucony brand running shoes for races, and the Reebok's simply do not measure up in terms of support for your foot. If you plan on purchasing these for distance running, do yourself a favor and go with a trusted brand of running shoes such as Asics, Saucony, or Brooks. These are nice shoes; however, they look bigger than other shoes when you wear them. They fit nicely but there design is weird. They look funny on my feet so I decided to return them. But this show is awesome. Super lightweight and you can literally feel your feet breathing as u walk. Super stylish and incredibly comfortable. Ive been stayin on top of wiping them clean and plan to keep it goin. Highly reccomend Shoes fit just as I would expect a size 10 to. Comfortable and supportive, although a little thin. They dont feel as robust as some competitors shoes with similar design - but overall I enjoy these shoes quite a bit. Was able to stand and walk all day without any back pain and with minimal knee pain, which was a main concern. They are really comfortable. Great product. Everything is perfect with these shoes. Just have to make sure if you are wearing hort socks that they are not too short as the shoe is rubbing against the back of your foot and after an hour or so its enough to get a small wound and even blood a bit. Very nice shoes. Great colors. I really like these. Comfortable. Definitely wear these on a flat even surface or track.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N1YQFNV/ref=asc_df_B01N1YQFNV5866986?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B01N1YQFNV&linkCode=asn&psc=1

I chose the orange/black combination, looks very nice - would prefer if the dark portion on the side of the shoe was not glossy but that's a small nit pick. The bottom is blinding to look at though, VERY orange - wish they'd mixed a bit more grey into that. I took a chance getting these online, I usually prefer to try them on in person rather than wait a while to do so. Sizing was correct at 9.5 length, I used the shoe size estimate tool to help select the best one for me using my old shoe. Quite impressed how well the tool worked that out. The insole feels very comfortable, if a bit snug. It feels as though there is more support in this pair than my old one as well, the ball of my foot has a lot of support as well as the arches. The shoe is very snug on the top of my feet though, and a little bit on the sides. I use the heck out of my old Sauconys so I may have flattened the insole completely in my old pair giving my foot more room. These larger shoes fit perfectly and allowed 1/2 size for swelling that occurs with our feet when exercising. The arch support and width were excellent. The width is equal to a medium and the arch support is comfortable, but not too high, and I tend to be flat footed. Another great pair of Saucony shoes, great fit and comfort. The 4mm offset is such a super selling point for these shoes, lets my foot quit crawling to the end of the shoe. I recommend Saucony to all. This pair of Saucony got great arch support and soft cushion. Goes to show that I don't need to buy from big names to get good shoes. I liked these shoes at first and used them a lot as a trainer shoe. Before this issue I would have said it was a great shoe at a great price. Wonderful, feels great for walking or jogging. You can tell it is of good quality. I definitely will be buying more from Saucony when the time comes. These were a great price & made of better materials than his previous pair. I use shoe inserts and tested these out--feels good to walk and run around in. The pattern on the shoe is not that stylish--but I was looking for something to run/walk in at the gym, and these are great for that.	https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075FCKX2H/ref=asc_df_B075FCKX2H1555758000000?tag=runrepcom-20&creative=395261&creativeASIN=B075FCKX2H&linkCode=asn&psc=1

Over the past 5 years I've gone through about 6 pairs of these between the XR Missions and the X-Mission 3's, and they never fail to impress. Only gripe I have about them is that the back of the shoes tend to wear out first, and when they do you have to replace them pretty quickly unless you want blisters. Overall, I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of cross-trail shoes. I have a slightly wide foot, and it worked out well.

Paired them with running inserts and they are like a dream. Only 30 miles on them so far, but I like them. Maybe I should run straight:) Very comfortable. The fresh foam series by New Balance is a breakthrough in shoe comfort. Although, I put a third party insole in place, you could get by with the enclosed insole and still enjoy a comfortable ride.

Despite this, I still think they are great looking shoes for walking around/lounging around, just not for long-distance running. These though, light, comfortable, the heel is great and lessened the impact of constant walking for 10 hours. Only complaint is the backs trap along the Achilles tends to fold in when you are putting it on, but thats pretty minor. I run occasionally to have the ability to move my heavy body quickly and for my health. If your a straight runner go with the pure boost. Recently I ran for charity and ran 9.19 miles in these shoes. Amazing Value. As a bonus these shoes look extremely good working out and in casual clothes. Definitely the most comfortable pair of shoes I've owned. The fit was also questionable for the size, and looks overall flimsy for the price of these shoes. EDIT: I ended up repurchasing from another source for $65 (including tax), and can confirm that I DID receive a different shoe that what Adidas sells, although it looked VERY similar to the untrained eye and DID have the boost material. I had to place extra insoles to compensate for this, even though I bought the size I normally purchase in regular non Boost Adidas. I would say they run a quarter size large for Chinese/Indonesian made shoes, not other Asian countries like Vietnam, where you have to size up another half size. Very comfortable and light in weight. Word of advice these shoes are made from a light fabric, so do not wear on a rainy day or your feet will be soaked. Wear a 10, ordered 9.5's, fit well. This is a great shoe. They are a great running shoe that provides great cushion and support. I primarily use them for running on a treadmill, and they work great for this.	https://www.amazon.com/adidas-Performance-Mens-Solar-Running/dp/B0119GWC6I?SubscriptionId=AKIAING73PPL74JOUHRA&tag=runrepcom-rn-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B0119D8EVS&psc=1

One of the reasons I buy Reebok is because they seem to fit and conform better to my foot than other brands of shoes that I've tried. While these are certainly comfortable, they don't fit quite the same as pairs that I've purchased in the past. I would still recommend them, but you might want to see if you can try some on before you buy them. He really likes them but they are too tight overall for his normal size. He especially likes the style. Nice shoes but not supportive at all, Feel nice for walking or ocassionally running These are for my son to run cross country in. He loves them and they fit him perfectly. Great fitting shoe. It fits well and is very comfortable. Wore for a 5k without any pain.
